Case Study 1
Title: A 67-Year-Old Woman with Alternating Sixth Cranial Nerve Palsy
Case Study:  Dr. Zandra E. Walton (Medicine): A 67-year-old woman was evaluated at this hospital because of headache and retro-orbital pain. The patient had been in her usual state of health until 10 months before the current admission, when a photosensitive, erythematous, papular rash developed on the forearms a few weeks after she had started treatment with hydrochlorothiazide. Over the next 7 months, an intermittent, painless, nonpruritic, erythematous, annular rash developed on the trunk and the proximal portions of the arms and legs. Three months before the current presentation, the rashes worsened, and the patient was evaluated by a dermatologist at another hospital. The thyrotropin level was normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Examination of a punch-biopsy specimen of abdominal skin reportedly showed spongiotic dermatitis with superficial perivascular lymphocytic inflammatory-cell infiltrate with eosinophils; neither vasculitis nor dermal mucin was found. The rashes were thought to be related to medication; treatment with amlodipine was started, and hydrochlorothiazide was discontinued. She was treated with topical triamcinolone ointment. The photosensitive rash on the forearms resolved, and the annular rash on the trunk abated. Ten days after the evaluation at the first hospital, and 8 weeks before the current admission, the patient presented to the emergency department of a second hospital because of progressive temporal headache with retro-orbital pain on the left side that had lasted for 3 days. The physical examination was reportedly normal. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 12 mm per hour (reference range, 0 to 19). The complete blood count and blood levels of electrolytes, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and total bilirubin were normal, as were the results of tests of kidney function. Computed tomography (CT) of the head was performed and reportedly showed mild periventricular white-matter disease with no acute intracranial abnormality. CT angiography of the head and neck reportedly showed no intracranial aneurysm, stenosis, or occlusion. The patient was discharged home. The next morning, the patient awoke with double vision. The headache had resolved. She presented to a neuro-ophthalmology urgent care clinic associated with this hospital. The patient reported persistent pain in the left eye, which was worse with abduction, as well as photosensitivity and an episode of pain in the left side of the jaw in the preceding week. She had normal visual acuity, color vision, visual fields, and afferent visual function. The optic disks were normal, sharp, and flat. The left eye had esotropia and hypertropia, as well as a limitation in abduction. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 11 mm per hour, and the C-reactive protein level was 3.0 mg per liter (reference value, <8.0). A presumptive diagnosis of acute left sixth cranial nerve palsy associated with cerebral microvascular disease was considered. Corrective treatment with eye patching was recommended, and the double vision resolved over the next 3 weeks. Eight weeks after she had presented to the emergency department of the second hospital, the patient presented to the emergency department of a third hospital because similar symptoms had developed in her right eye. She reported having headache with retro-orbital pain on the right side over the past 3 days, accompanied by changes in her color vision and occasional floaters. The physical examination was notable for a blood pressure of 159/66 mm Hg and an abduction deficit of the right eye. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 17 mm per hour (reference range, 0 to 30), and the high-sensitivity C-reactive protein level was 1.64 mg per liter (reference value, <3.00). The complete blood count and blood levels of electrolytes, albumin, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and total bilirubin were normal, as were the results of tests of kidney function. A screening test for Lyme disease antibodies was negative. Dr. Jeremy N. Ford: Cross-sectional imaging of the head and orbits had been performed at the first hospital, and the results were reinterpreted at the third hospital. CT of the head (Figure 1A and 1B) reportedly showed stranding of the intraconal fat in the right orbit. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance angiography of the head, neck, and orbits (performed with and without the administration of intravenous contrast material) reportedly showed abnormal enhancement and edema of the optic nerve and surrounding tissue on the right side. On my directed review of the MRI (Figure 1C through 1F), I found that the mild edema and enhancement predominantly involved the optic-nerve sheath and intraconal fat, which confirmed the findings on CT of the head. The optic nerve itself was largely spared. The temporomandibular joints were partially visible, and there was mild periarticular edema and enhancement of the left joint. On T2-weighted imaging, scattered hyperintense foci were seen in the periventricular and subcortical white matter, a nonspecific finding most likely attributable to chronic small-vessel disease. Dr. Walton: Intravenous methylprednisolone was administered, and the patient was transferred to the neurology unit of this hospital. On evaluation, she reported persistent double vision and pain on right lateral gaze but resolution of the retro-orbital headache. She also reported a recent mild flare of an erythematous, annular rash, as well as recent hair thinning and long-standing Raynaud’s phenomenon. Review of systems was negative for fever, night sweats, weight loss, joint erythema or swelling, muscle stiffness or pain, scalp or temple tenderness, jaw claudication, recurrent sinusitis, nasal crusting, epistaxis, cough, hoarseness, cough or shortness of breath, hemoptysis, dry mouth or dry eyes, oral ulcers, ptosis, dysphagia, dysarthria, hearing changes, paresthesia, weakness in the arms and legs, or changes in the nails. There were no gastrointestinal or urinary symptoms. The patient had a remote history of Graves’ disease with orbitopathy that had been diagnosed and treated more than two decades before this presentation. The medical history was also notable for hypothyroidism, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, cholecystectomy, ovary-sparing hysterectomy, and lumpectomy for estrogen-receptor–positive, progesterone receptor–positive breast cancer. A surveillance mammogram obtained in the previous month had reportedly been normal. She had received three vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Medications included atorvastatin, amlodipine, levothyroxine, and tamoxifen. A rash had occurred after the previous use of hydrochlorothiazide. She was married and lived in coastal Massachusetts. She drank wine rarely and did not use tobacco or other substances. Her family history was notable for a maternal aunt with thyroid disease and a child with vitiligo. On examination, the temporal temperature was 36.1°C, the pulse 68 beats per minute, the blood pressure 173/72 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 95% while the patient was breathing ambient air. A few scattered erythematous macules were present on the abdomen, including a well-healed punch-biopsy site. A few telangiectasias were observed on the face. There was no rash on the face or scalp, and no sclerodactyly was observed. The hair was normal in pattern and distribution. There was no conjunctival injection. Extraocular movements were normal except for abduction of the right eye, which was limited and caused pain. There was no proptosis or lid lag. Visual acuity was 20/25 in the left eye and 20/40 with red color desaturation in the right eye. The right optic disk appeared pale as compared with the left optic disk. The remainder of the general and neurologic examination was normal. An electrocardiogram was normal. The complete blood count and blood levels of electrolytes, calcium, albumin, and globulin were normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 6 mm per hour, and the C-reactive protein level was 0.6 mg per liter. Screening tests for antibodies to hepatitis B virus core antigen, hepatitis C virus, histone, and human immunodeficiency virus were negative, as were tests for Lyme disease antibodies, syphilis antibodies, rheumatoid factor, and varicella–zoster virus IgM; varicella–zoster virus IgG was detected. A test for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, an interferon-γ release assay for Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and serum and urine toxicology screens were also negative. A lumbar puncture was performed. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was clear, with an opening pressure of 14 cm of water. Gram’s staining of the CSF showed rare mononuclear cells and no organisms. The CSF glucose level was 86 mg per deciliter (4.8 mmol per liter; reference range, 50 to 75 mg per deciliter [2.8 to 4.2 mmol per liter]), and the CSF protein level was 30 mg per deciliter (reference range, 5 to 55). There were no nucleated cells present. On the second day, testing for antibodies to bartonella was negative. The levels of angiotensin-converting enzyme, C3, and C4 were normal, as were the results of serum free light-chain testing, serum protein electrophoresis, and urinalysis. The IgG4 level was 137.3 mg per deciliter (reference range, 3.9 to 86.4); the levels of other IgG subclasses were normal. Testing for lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibodies, and β2-glycoprotein 1 antibodies was negative, as was CSF testing for cryptococcal antigen and varicella–zoster virus IgM. Dr. Ford: CT of the chest, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, showed no lymphadenopathy; there was hepatic steatosis and a 2-mm right apical nodule. MRI of the head and whole spine, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, showed asymmetric enhancement surrounding the intraorbital and intracanalicular segments of the right optic-nerve sheath and intraconal fat. No abnormal spinal cord enhancement was observed. Ultrasonography of the temporal arteries showed no halo sign.

Case Study 2
Title: A 68-Year-Old Woman with Abnormal Movements and Confusion
Case Study:  Dr. D. Curtis Wegener (Neurology): A 68-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital because of worsening confusion and abnormal movements of the face, arms, and legs. The patient had been in her usual state of health until 9 weeks before the current presentation, when she presented to another hospital because of intermittent slurred speech and dizziness that had lasted for 1 day. The score on the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) was obtained; the NIHSS is an 11-component tool that assesses the severity of stroke, with scores ranging from 0 to 42 and higher scores indicating more severe neurologic deficits. Her NIHSS score was 1 owing to the presence of mild-to-moderate dysarthria, and she was not considered to be a candidate for treatment with intravenous tissue plasminogen activator. Imaging studies were obtained. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, reportedly revealed a punctate focus of restricted diffusion associated with mild signal hyperintensity involving the deep white matter of the left frontal lobe on T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) imaging. This finding was consistent with an acute ischemic infarct without hemorrhage or mass effect. There were also findings that had been observed on previous imaging, including foci of encephalomalacia in the right inferior frontal lobe and left occipital lobe that were related to previous trauma, a punctate old lacunar infarct in the inferior left cerebellar hemisphere, and superimposed patchy foci of T2-weighted and FLAIR white-matter hyperintensity most consistent with small-vessel disease. Magnetic resonance angiography of the head and neck reportedly showed no intracranial or cervical occlusion, high-grade stenosis, or aneurysm. The patient was admitted to the hospital. The patient had been taking apixaban daily because of a history of two deep venous thromboses, and the treatment was continued. She had also been taking atorvastatin for hyperlipidemia, and the dose was increased. Transthoracic echocardiography showed a normal left ventricular ejection fraction and no patent foramen ovale. Continuous telemetric monitoring showed no evidence of atrial fibrillation. Mobile cardiac telemetry was planned for the 30-day period after discharge. On the second hospital day, frequent irregular movements of the right leg developed, occurring every few seconds in a nonrhythmic pattern. The next day, similar movements of the right arm developed. The patient described the movements as involuntary and reported no uncontrollable urges or compulsions to move the arm or leg. Computed tomography (CT) of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, was reportedly negative for any new findings. Electroencephalography (EEG) was reportedly normal in the waking, drowsy, and light-sleep states. The dysarthria resolved, but the involuntary movements persisted. The patient was discharged home on the seventh hospital day. During the next 6 weeks, involuntary movements involving the arms, legs, and tongue occurred with increasing frequency. The patient began using a walker. Nine days before the current presentation, the patient was again admitted to the other hospital after multiple falls at home, which she attributed to uncontrolled movements of her arms and legs. On examination, she had nearly constant writhing, nonrhythmic, dancelike movements of the arms, legs, and trunk, as well as rolling movements of the tongue. She could stand up from a chair while holding onto a walker. Scattered bruises were present on the lower legs. Imaging studies were obtained. CT of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, reportedly showed mild scattered parenchymal hypodensities without hemorrhage or evidence of an acute infarct. A presumptive diagnosis of vascular chorea was made, and the patient was treated with oral levetiracetam. On the third hospital day, MRI of the head was attempted but was limited by motion artifacts due to involuntary movements. There were small foci of restricted diffusion in the right frontal and parietal periventricular white matter within the right corona radiata and centrum semiovale, findings consistent with new small acute-to-subacute infarcts without hemorrhage or mass effect. On the fourth hospital day, the dose of levetiracetam was increased. EEG reportedly showed excessive irregular background slow-wave activity without focal, lateralizing, or epileptiform features; there were no findings that correlated to the movements of the head and body. On the fifth hospital day, the irregular movements had not abated, and treatment with levetiracetam was stopped. Treatment with low-dose clonazepam at bedtime was started to help with sleep. On the sixth hospital day, the patient was discharged to a rehabilitation facility. Three days after discharge, a family member observed that the patient was confused and unable to maintain a conversation. The family member brought her to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation. In the emergency department, the patient was not able to provide additional information. Other medical history, obtained from the family member, included hypothyroidism, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, pulmonary hypertension, and vitiligo. Medications included ambrisentan, apixaban, atorvastatin, cholecalciferol, glipizide, levothyroxine, metformin, omeprazole, and sitagliptin. Clonazepam had not been administered at the rehabilitation facility. The patient had taken warfarin for many years for her history of two deep venous thromboses; 10 months before the current presentation, treatment had been switched from warfarin to apixaban. Acetylsalicylic acid had caused hives; there were no other known allergies. Before being discharged to the rehabilitation facility, the patient had lived alone in a suburban area and had worked in a school. She was a lifelong nonsmoker and drank alcohol rarely. Her father and brother had diabetes mellitus; there was no family history of abnormal movements or stroke. The temperature was 36.6°C, the blood pressure 125/60 mm Hg, the pulse 79 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 94% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 23.6. The patient was sleepy but arousable with verbal stimuli. She was oriented to self but not to time or place. She could follow simple commands with repeated instructions but could not follow complex commands. She had irregular spontaneous movements of the face, mouth, and tongue; she also had irregular spontaneous writhing movements of the arms and legs that were partially suppressible. When she was asked to hold her arms outstretched with the palms facing upward while keeping her eyes closed, her right arm drifted downward, and the palm pronated toward the floor. Strength was 4 out of 5 on right shoulder abduction, elbow flexion, elbow extension, wrist flexion, and wrist extension; the remainder of the examination was normal. Blood levels of electrolytes, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and alkaline phosphatase were normal, as were the results of kidney-function tests. Urinalysis showed trace ketones and 1+ leukocyte esterase (reference value, negative); the urine sediment showed 0 to 2 white cells per high-power field (reference value, <10). The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 44 mm per hour (reference range for women in the patient’s age group, 0 to 40). Additional laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Dr. Hillary R. Kelly: CT of the head performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, as well as CT angiography of the head and neck performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, showed no evidence of an acute territorial infarct and no change in the long-term findings, including the previously described areas of encephalomalacia and periventricular white-matter hypodensity. MRI of the head (Figure 1), performed with and without the administration of intravenous contrast material, showed multiple foci of restricted diffusion associated with T2-weighted and FLAIR hyperintensity, findings consistent with acute-to-early subacute infarcts. Foci were scattered throughout the cortex and subcortical white matter of both cerebral hemispheres. The most prominent foci were located along the left temporo-occipital junction. Numerous foci involved the cortex of the frontal and parietal lobes along the precentral and postcentral gyri. There was a small punctate focus of restricted diffusion associated with T2-weighted and FLAIR hyperintensity in the right superior cerebellar hemisphere, a finding consistent with an additional small infarct. There was no associated hemorrhage or mass effect. Magnetic resonance angiography of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, showed no intracranial occlusion, high-grade stenosis, or aneurysm.

Case Study 3
Title: A 79-Year-Old Man with Involuntary Movements and Unresponsiveness
Case Study:  Dr. Carrie Chui (Neurology): A 79-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of involuntary movements on the left side and transient unresponsiveness. The patient had been in his usual state of health until 9 months before admission, when involuntary movements of the left shoulder and left side of the face developed. The movements were described by the patient as twitching, were not associated with a change in the level of consciousness, and resolved after 1 to 2 minutes. During the next 6 months, the patient had similar episodes approximately once per month, but the episodes increased in duration, lasting 5 to 6 minutes. Three months before admission, the episodes of involuntary movements increased in frequency, and the patient was evaluated by his primary care physician. The physical examination was normal. Results of kidney-function tests were normal, as were blood levels of glucose and electrolytes, except for the sodium level, which was 129 mmol per liter (reference range, 135 to 145). There was a history of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion, and the sodium level was similar to levels obtained during the past 4 years. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head (Figure 1A), performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a focus of enhancement in the right middle frontal gyrus that was thought to be a small vascular anomaly. Electroencephalography (EEG), performed with the patient in awake and drowsy states, revealed rare, brief, focal slowing in the left temporal lobe during drowsiness; no epileptiform abnormalities were present. Two months before admission, the patient was evaluated in the epilepsy clinic affiliated with this hospital. He reported that the episodes of involuntary movements had increased in both frequency and duration, occurring once or twice per day and lasting approximately 10 minutes. Episodes began with tingling and numbness in the left leg that prompted the patient to voluntarily stomp the left foot to relieve the uncomfortable sensation. Then, the patient had involuntary movements that he described as an uncontrollable invisible force moving the left leg and arm, with hyperextension of the arm backward and pronation of the wrist. There was associated numbness in the distal portions of the left third, fourth, and fifth fingers and involuntary movement of the left cheek. No prodromal symptoms occurred. The patient had awareness during the episodes, and after the episodes, he felt fatigued but had a normal level of consciousness, without confusion. The examination in the epilepsy clinic was normal. A diagnosis of seizure disorder was considered, and treatment with levetiracetam was started. Three weeks before admission, the patient was again evaluated in the epilepsy clinic. He reported that the episodes of involuntary movements still occurred on a daily basis but had decreased in duration and involved only the left leg, without abnormal movements of the arm or face. Dizziness, headache, and weakness had developed and were attributed to the use of levetiracetam. The patient’s family had recorded a video of one of the episodes of involuntary movements. After reviewing the video, the patient’s neurologist thought that the episodes were less likely to be caused by seizures and more consistent with choreoathetoid movements. Cross-tapering of medications — with the simultaneous administration of levetiracetam in decreasing doses and clobazam in increasing doses — was initiated, and the patient was referred to the movement disorders clinic affiliated with this hospital. On the morning of admission, an episode of involuntary movements of the left leg and left shoulder occurred and persisted for 1 hour. Several hours after the symptoms abated, the patient’s wife found the patient to be unresponsive; he was sitting in a chair. Emergency medical services were called, and when they arrived, the patient was responsive. The fingerstick blood glucose level was 180 mg per deciliter (10.0 mmol per liter) and the blood pressure 110/80 mm Hg. The patient was transported to the emergency department of this hospital for further evaluation. In the emergency department, the patient reported dysuria and increased urinary frequency. The patient’s daughter noted that he had been more anxious during the past 3 years and occasionally had trouble with memory. Other medical history included Barrett’s esophagus, benign prostatic hypertrophy, chronic hepatitis B virus infection, eczema, gastroesophageal reflux disease, hypertension, nonischemic cardiomyopathy, and osteoporosis. There was no history of head trauma or extended loss of consciousness. Medications included aspirin, atorvastatin, doxazosin, finasteride, omeprazole, metoprolol, sacubitril, and valsartan. There were no known drug allergies. The patient was a lifelong nonsmoker and drank alcohol rarely; he did not use illicit drugs. His mother had had gastric cancer, and his sister had had esophageal cancer; there was no family history of seizures. On examination, the temporal temperature was 36.8°C, the blood pressure 152/97 mm Hg, the pulse 65 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 96% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 21.7. The blood pressure decreased to 130/63 mm Hg with standing. The patient was alert and interactive. The lower jaw was held to the left, but the nasolabial folds and smile were symmetric with activation. There were nonrhythmic, nonstereotyped, writhing movements of the left arm. Tone was normal, and strength was assessed as 5 out of 5 in the arms and legs. Results of liver-function and kidney-function tests were normal, as were blood levels of glucose and electrolytes, except for the sodium level, which was 125 mmol per liter. The lactate level was 2.1 mmol per liter (19 mg per deciliter; reference range, 0.5 to 2.0 mmol per liter [5 to 18 mg per deciliter]). The urinalysis was normal. Intravenous fluids were administered. Imaging studies were obtained. Dr. Rajiv Gupta: Computed tomographic (CT) angiography of the head and neck (Figure 1B) revealed extensively calcified plaque with severe stenosis of the distal right common carotid artery (CCA), extending into the proximal right internal carotid artery (ICA), as well as stenosis of the right and left paraclinoid ICAs and the left vertebral artery at its origin. There was no vascular abnormality on the CT angiogram that corresponded to the abnormality in the right middle frontal gyrus seen on the previous MRI. Dr. Chui: The patient was admitted to the hospital. On the second hospital day, the sodium level had increased to 130 mmol per liter, and the lactate level was normal. Additional imaging studies were obtained. Dr. Gupta: MRI of the head showed no evidence of acute infarction. The focus of enhancement in the right frontal lobe that had been noted previously was not seen on the current MRI. Dr. Chui: Blood levels of thyrotropin, cobalamin, and glycated hemoglobin and results of coagulation tests were normal. Screening tests for Lyme disease, tuberculosis, and syphilis were negative, as were tests for antibodies to cardiolipin and β2-glycoprotein. A test for antinuclear antibodies was positive, at a titer of 1:160 in a homogeneous pattern. During a physical therapy session, the patient had abnormal movements of the left leg, left arm, and left side of the face. The abnormal movements diminished when the patient used distraction techniques, such as thigh tapping, finger snapping, and walking while holding a glass of water. The transient unresponsiveness that led to the patient’s admission was attributed to a combination of sedation from clobazam and hypovolemia. Treatment with clobazam was stopped, and hydration was encouraged. A diagnosis of functional neurologic disorder was considered; outpatient physical therapy with continued use of distraction techniques was recommended. The patient was discharged home on the third hospital day. Episodes of involuntary movements continued to occur on a daily basis at home. Two weeks after discharge, when the patient was doing exercises while sitting in a chair and having a conversation with his wife, he suddenly stopped talking. She found him slumped in the chair with his eyes closed, no longer exercising. When she asked him questions, he repeatedly said “yes.” Emergency medical services were called, and when they arrived, the patient was alert, diaphoretic, and nonverbal. He had a facial droop on the left side and a right gaze preference. The fingerstick blood glucose level was 130 mg per deciliter (7.2 mmol per liter) and the blood pressure 120/60 mm Hg. The patient was transported to the emergency department of this hospital for further evaluation. In the emergency department, the temporal temperature was 36.6°C, the blood pressure 143/63 mm Hg, the pulse 66 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. He was alert and interactive. There was a facial droop on the left side. There was no effort against gravity in the left arm. The patient was able to lift the left leg off the bed for 1 to 2 seconds. He had a right gaze deviation that could not be overcome and mild dysarthria. The remainder of the examination was normal. A diagnosis of stroke was considered, and emergency CT angiography was performed. Dr. Gupta: CT angiography showed no evidence of acute territorial infarction and no changes in cerebrovascular disease. Dr. Chui: On repeat physical examination performed after CT angiography, the gaze deviation and dysarthria had resolved, and strength was normal. Mild facial paralysis was present.

Case Study 4
Title: A 58-Year-Old Woman with Fatigue, Abdominal Bloating, and Eosinophilia
Case Study:  Dr. Rachel M. Erdil (Medicine): A 58-year-old woman was evaluated in the infectious disease clinic of this hospital because of fatigue, abdominal bloating, and eosinophilia. The patient had been in her usual state of health until 8 months before the current evaluation, when she fell and injured her right leg while hiking in a rainforest in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Before this injury, she had been traveling throughout the DRC for 1 month. She had hiked, walked barefoot, and gone swimming in freshwater lakes and rivers. Approximately 55 hours after the fall, the patient was transported to the trauma center of a regional hospital. Imaging studies revealed fractures of the right tibia with associated hemorrhage. Packed red cells were transfused, and an external fixation device was placed. Once the patient’s condition was stable, she was transferred to a hospital in the United States. At the second hospital, the eosinophil count was 3530 per microliter (reference range, 0 to 400); the eosinophil count had been normal 18 months earlier. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. One week after the fall, open reduction and internal fixation of the fracture was performed. The patient started physical therapy and was discharged home. The patient had persistent weight gain and mild fatigue, which had developed 4 years before the current presentation. She had associated these symptoms with the onset of menopause. However, after the traumatic leg injury, she noticed that the symptoms increased in severity. One month before the current evaluation, the patient’s weight had increased by 8.6 kg since the leg injury, and she took a 1-hour nap every afternoon because of fatigue. In addition, she had new abdominal bloating that did not abate with the use of probiotics. The patient sought evaluation at a clinic associated with the second hospital. On evaluation, the results of blood tests for thyroid, kidney, and liver function were normal, as were blood levels of electrolytes. A test for Lyme disease was negative. The results of testing for Epstein–Barr virus (EBV)–specific antibodies and other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Two weeks before the current evaluation, the patient moved to New England and established care in the primary care clinic of this hospital. She continued to receive physical therapy for rehabilitation of the right leg. She reported that the weight gain, fatigue, and abdominal bloating had worsened at a rapid rate; her weight had increased by 13.6 kg since the leg injury. The patient was referred to the infectious disease clinic of this hospital. The patient had a history of chronic migraines and hyperlipidemia. Review of systems was notable for mild cough and swelling of the right knee that began after the surgery. She had no fever, hot flashes, night sweats, headache, shortness of breath, chest pain, abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, myalgias, arthralgias, or rash. Current medications included levothyroxine and probiotics. There were no known allergies. The patient had previously traveled to the southwestern United States, North and East Africa, western Europe, and South and Southeast Asia. She currently lived in a suburban area of New England with her husband and cats in a house that had mold. She did not smoke tobacco, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. On examination, the temperature was 36.1°C, the blood pressure 98/66 mm Hg, the heart rate 73 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 24.9. She appeared well. The lungs were clear on auscultation, and the abdomen was soft and nontender; there was no hepatomegaly or lymphadenopathy. The right knee and leg had healed surgical scars. The skin examination was normal. The eosinophil count was 1760 per microliter. Tests for syphilis, human immunodeficiency virus infection, and strongyloidiasis were negative. The urinalysis was normal. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Dr. Vincent V. Dinculescu: Computed tomography (CT) of the chest and abdomen (Figure 1), performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed calcified, nonenlarged subcarinal lymph nodes, along with calcified lesions in the right lung, liver, and spleen, findings suggestive of granulomatous disease. There was also a low-attenuation hepatic lesion measuring 1.6 cm in diameter, which was probably a cyst.

Case Study 5
Title: A 44-Year-Old Woman with Muscle Weakness and Myalgia
Case Study:  Dr. Chidiebere D. Akusobi (Medicine): A 44-year-old woman was evaluated in the rheumatology clinic of this hospital because of proximal muscle weakness and myalgia. The patient had been in her usual state of health until 5 years before the current presentation, when morning stiffness and pain developed in the small joints of both hands. Laboratory evaluation reportedly revealed elevated blood levels of anti–cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) antibodies and rheumatoid factor, as well as an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Rheumatoid arthritis was diagnosed, but the patient chose not to begin specific therapy for rheumatoid arthritis. Instead, she began taking selenium, cod-liver oil, and turmeric as home remedies for joint pain. Morning stiffness and joint pain resolved after 4 weeks. Four years before the current presentation, treatment with hydroxychloroquine was started after the occurrence of another episode of morning stiffness and pain in the small joints of the hands. Three years before the current presentation, treatment with hydroxychloroquine was stopped after melasma developed. Treatment with methotrexate was initiated, but morning hand stiffness and pain recurred; methotrexate was replaced with leflunomide, and the symptoms in the hands subsequently decreased. Six months before the current presentation, the patient began to have myalgia in the arms and thighs, as well as generalized fatigue. She had difficulty raising her arms above her head, and she could no longer independently brush her hair or apply makeup. Myalgia worsened with exercise and was worst at the end of the day. The patient reported episodes of tingling in the hands and feet, but she had no stiffness or pain in the small joints of her hands. Three months before the current presentation, the patient was evaluated by a local rheumatologist and laboratory testing was performed. The blood level of creatine kinase was 422 U per liter (reference range, 40 to 150) and the lactate dehydrogenase level 509 U per liter (reference range, 110 to 210). Antinuclear antibodies (ANA) were detected at a titer of 1:320 in a nuclear homogenous pattern, and anti–U1-ribonucleoprotein (U1-RNP) antibodies were present. The blood levels of C3 and C4 were normal, and testing for anti–double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) and anti-Smith antibodies was negative. Two months before the current presentation, treatment with azathioprine was started, and the patient was referred to the rheumatology clinic of this hospital. In the rheumatology clinic, the patient reported ongoing myalgia and tingling in the hands and feet but had noticed an improvement in her ability to raise her arms above her head after starting treatment with azathioprine. Two weeks earlier, episodes of muscle spasms in the hands and fingers had developed; massage of the hands had been performed to relax the spasms. The patient had a history of Graves’ disease, which had been complicated by ophthalmoplegia and had been treated with methimazole for 2 years, followed by radioactive iodine ablation 11 years before this presentation; hypothyroidism had developed after radioactive iodine ablation therapy. Other history included latent tuberculosis infection, which had been treated with a 3-month course of isoniazid and rifampin, and hypoparathyroidism that had developed 9 years before this presentation. Medications included azathioprine, levothyroxine, calcium supplements, and calcitriol; the patient was unsure of the formulation and dose of calcium supplementation. She lived outside the United States and traveled intermittently to Boston for specialized medical care. She lived with her mother and worked in information technology. She drank alcohol occasionally, smoked cigarettes, and used no illicit drugs. A sibling had systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). On examination, the temporal temperature was 36.3°C, the blood pressure 145/70 mm Hg, the pulse 72 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. She had mild exophthalmos in both eyes. There was an area of hyperpigmentation on the face. The joints had a normal range of motion without tenderness on palpation; there was no synovitis. Neck flexion was mildly weak, as was hip flexion; strength was otherwise normal, as was sensation. There was no rash. The remainder of the examination was normal.

Case Study 6
Title: A 76-Year-Old Man with Dizziness and Altered Mental Status
Case Study:  Dr. George Karandinos (Medicine): A 76-year-old man was evaluated in the emergency department of this hospital because of dizziness and altered mental status. On the day of the current evaluation, the patient was observed crawling on a city sidewalk. He appeared pale and diaphoretic. On evaluation by emergency medical services, he reported feeling dizzy and “weird.” A fingerstick blood glucose level was 152 mg per deciliter (8.4 mmol per liter). He was brought to the emergency department of this hospital for further evaluation. In the emergency department, the patient could not recall recent events, but he reported shortness of breath, as well as chronic back pain and persistent ringing in the ears. He was unable to give additional details of his history, but he provided the name of the hospital where he routinely received care. On a phone consultation, physicians at that hospital reported that the patient had a history of traumatic brain injury, post-traumatic stress disorder, seizure disorder, chronic back pain due to spinal stenosis, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, chronic kidney disease, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and anxiety. Prescribed medications included lisinopril and transdermal lidocaine. There were no known drug allergies. The patient had consumed alcohol in the past but not for 40 years. His family history was unknown. The temporal temperature was 36.6°C, the heart rate 92 beats per minute, the blood pressure 183/113 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 27 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The patient appeared disheveled and diaphoretic. He was somnolent but awakened to verbal stimuli. He was oriented to person, place, and time but only intermittently followed commands. A small superficial skin abrasion was noted above the left eyebrow. There was mild tenderness on palpation of the midback but no other evidence of trauma. The remainder of the examination was normal. Point-of-care ultrasonography, performed with an approach known as FAST (focused assessment with sonography for trauma), showed no abnormalities. The blood ethanol level was undetectable, and urine toxicologic testing was negative for amphetamines, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, cannabinoids, cocaine, and opiates. The blood levels of lipase, magnesium, and N-terminal pro–B-type natriuretic peptide were normal, as were results of liver-function tests. There was mild normocytic anemia, but the complete blood count with differential count was otherwise normal. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Testing of a nasopharyngeal swab for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 was negative. Samples of blood and urine were obtained for culture. An electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm, intraventricular conduction delay, left axis deviation, and nonspecific minor ST-segment and T-wave abnormalities. Imaging studies were obtained. Dr. Brooks P. Applewhite: Radiographs of the chest and pelvis showed no acute abnormalities. Computed tomographic (CT) angiography of the head and neck (Figure 1A) revealed nonspecific mild white-matter changes, a nonspecific small focal calcification in the right-peritrigonal white matter, atherosclerosis without high-grade cerebrovascular stenosis, and multilevel spondylotic changes without severe spinal canal stenosis. There was no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or territorial infarction. CT angiography of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis (Figure 1B and 1C) revealed no evidence of aortic dissection, pulmonary embolism, pneumothorax, pulmonary edema, lung consolidation, or pericardial effusion. There was a left adrenal nodule that measured 19 mm in diameter, a finding consistent with an adenoma. Dr. Karandinos: Normal saline with 5% dextrose was administered intravenously. During the next 8 hours, the patient was agitated and combative. He repeatedly removed peripheral intravenous catheters and disconnected monitors. He was no longer oriented to place or time. Two doses of olanzapine were administered intravenously, and the patient slept for several hours during the night. Sixteen hours after the patient arrived in the emergency department, the temporal temperature was 37.7°C, the heart rate 78 beats per minute, the blood pressure 160/72 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while he was breathing ambient air. The patient was observed to be breathing deeply. He was able to state his name, but his speech was otherwise nonsensical and dysarthric. He followed commands only when visual cues were given; for example, he stuck out his tongue after the examiner demonstrated the task. Motor, sensory, and reflex examinations were normal; tests of cerebellar function were not performed. Additional laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. The results of electroencephalography (EEG) were normal, without epileptiform abnormalities. Normal saline with potassium chloride was administered intravenously, as was lorazepam. Additional imaging studies were obtained. Dr. Applewhite: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head (Figure 2) revealed no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or acute or subacute infarction. T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images showed a mild burden of white-matter signal hyperintensities, which are nonspecific but typical of chronic small-vessel disease. The previously detected calcification in the right-peritrigonal white matter correlated with an 8-mm focus of T1 and T2 signal abnormalities with associated susceptibility blooming, a finding suggestive of either a calcified cavernous malformation or sequelae of previous infection or inflammation. Dr. Karandinos: The patient’s mental status did not improve. Twenty-four hours after he arrived in the emergency department, he was admitted to the hospital with a working diagnosis of seizure. The temporal temperature was 37.6°C, the heart rate 77 beats per minute, the blood pressure 151/70 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while he was breathing ambient air. Respiratory effort appeared increased. He was somnolent, and he followed simple commands but did not open his eyes in response to sternal rub. The blood levels of creatine kinase, fibrinogen, and ammonia were normal. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Thiamine was administered intravenously. Additional diagnostic tests were performed.

Case Study 7
Title: An 11-Year-Old Girl with Redness of the Eyes
Case Study:  Dr. Natalie A. Diacovo (Pediatrics): An 11-year-old girl was evaluated in the rheumatology clinic of this hospital because of redness of the eyes. The patient had been well until 8 weeks before the current evaluation, when she noticed mild eye redness, which was worse in the right eye than in the left eye. There was intermittent swelling of the eyelids but no photophobia, itching, pain, tearing, or discharge. The patient’s parents administered naphazoline hydrochloride and glycerin eye drops, but the eye redness did not abate. When the eye redness had persisted for 2 weeks, the patient was taken to the pediatrics clinic of another hospital. She was given a 7-day course of an oral antibiotic agent as empirical treatment for possible preseptal cellulitis. Five weeks before the current evaluation, the eye redness persisted despite treatment, and the patient was referred to the ophthalmology clinic of the other hospital. The blood pressure was not measured during this evaluation. The visual acuity with correction was 20/20 in the right eye and 20/25 in the left eye. The pupils were symmetric and reactive to light, with no relative afferent pupillary defect. Slit-lamp examination revealed abundant white cells in the anterior chamber of both eyes, with a greater amount in the right eye than in the left eye. There were also keratic precipitates, posterior synechiae, and rare iris nodules in the right eye. Funduscopic examination was notable for optic-disk swelling and peripheral retinal hemorrhages in both eyes, as well as perivascular exudates in the right eye. Cyclopentolate eye drops in the right eye and prednisolone eye drops in both eyes were prescribed. During the subsequent 3 weeks, additional tests were performed in the pediatrics clinic of the other hospital. Screening blood tests for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) types 1 and 2, syphilis, and Lyme disease were negative. An interferon-γ release assay for M. tuberculosis was indeterminate. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Radiography of the chest revealed hilar fullness. Dr. Maria G. Figueiro Longo: Computed tomography (CT) of the chest and abdomen (Figure 1A and 1B), performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, showed a normal-appearing thymus. However, diffuse lymphadenopathy was detected in the mediastinum, upper abdomen, and axillae, with the largest lymph node measuring 2.0 cm by 1.3 cm by 1.8 cm. Dr. Diacovo: Two weeks before the current evaluation, the patient was asked to present to the emergency department of the other hospital for an expedited workup. On evaluation, she described eye redness that had persisted but decreased in severity. She reported no fever, weight loss, night sweats, rash, headache, cough, shortness of breath, or joint pain. On examination, the temperature was 37.0°C, the blood pressure 96/61 mm Hg, the heart rate 95 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while she was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 18.3. The patient appeared well, with no oral lesions or rash. The visual acuity was unchanged. Slit-lamp examination revealed keratic precipitates and white cells in the anterior chamber of both eyes, with a greater amount in the right eye than in the left eye. There were extensive posterior synechiae in the right eye. Funduscopic examination (Figure 2) showed vitreous white cells, optic-disk swelling, perivascular exudates, peripheral retinal hemorrhages, and cotton-wool spots in both eyes. The lungs were clear on auscultation. Urinalysis was normal. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Methylprednisolone was administered, and the patient was admitted to the other hospital. During the next 4 days, additional tests were performed, and sputum specimens were obtained for an acid-fast bacilli smear and culture. Optical coherence tomography revealed optic-disk swelling but no cystoid macular swelling. Fluorescein angiography revealed optic-disk leakage with areas of peripheral retinal nonperfusion and some vessel leakage. Dr. Figueiro Longo: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head (Figure 1C), performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, showed protrusion and enhancement of the optic disks and enhancement of the irises, a finding consistent with the clinical diagnosis of uveitis. There was no evidence of optic neuritis or perineuritis. Dr. Diacovo: The administration of cyclopentolate eye drops in the right eye and prednisolone eye drops in both eyes was continued. Treatment with oral prednisone was started, and a regimen of rifampin, isoniazid, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide was begun as empirical treatment for possible tuberculosis. On the fifth hospital day, the patient was discharged home. She was instructed to follow up in the ophthalmology clinic of the other hospital and was referred to the rheumatology clinic of this hospital. In the rheumatology clinic, additional history was obtained. The patient had had normal growth and development and was currently in middle school. She had received all routine childhood vaccinations. She had emigrated from West Africa to the United States 6 years earlier; since then, she had lived with her mother and father in a suburban town in New England and had not traveled outside the region. Six months before this evaluation, an interferon-γ release assay for M. tuberculosis had been positive. At that time, the patient had received a prescription for a medication to treat latent tuberculosis infection; however, the patient’s parents could not recall giving the medication to the patient. She was taking the prescribed cyclopentolate and prednisolone eye drops, oral prednisone, and regimen of rifampin, isoniazid, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide. There were no known drug allergies. The patient’s parents were healthy.

Case Study 8
Title: A 17-Year-Old Girl with Fever and Cough
Case Study:  Dr. Samantha D. Martin (Pediatrics): A 17-year-old girl was admitted to this hospital during the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic because of fever and cough. The patient had been well until 10 days before admission, when fever and cough that was productive of clear sputum developed. She also had fatigue, eye redness, sore throat, nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, and myalgias. Seven days before this admission, the patient was evaluated in the urgent care clinic of another hospital. On examination, there was conjunctival injection in both eyes. The lungs were clear on auscultation, and the remainder of the physical examination was reportedly normal. Testing of a nasopharyngeal specimen for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA was negative. Treatment with acetaminophen and dextromethorphan was recommended. During the next 2 days, the fever decreased but did not resolve with the use of acetaminophen. New mild chest discomfort occurred with coughing. An expectorated sputum specimen contained flecks of blood, and the patient returned to the urgent care clinic. The physical examination was unchanged, and rapid antigen testing for influenza types A and B was negative. Additional treatment with ibuprofen, benzonatate, and guaifenesin was recommended. Three days before this admission, the patient had persistent symptoms and was unable to sleep because of the fever and cough. New shortness of breath developed. She was evaluated by a primary care physician at the other hospital in a telehealth visit. Empirical treatment with amoxicillin was started, and close monitoring was recommended. During the next 3 days, the shortness of breath increased in severity, and the patient was instructed to present to the emergency department of this hospital. On evaluation, the patient reported cough that was worse with exertion and deep breathing, improved with rest, and was associated with pain in the chest and back on the left side. The sputum had streaks of bright red blood. Other symptoms included fatigue, sore throat, nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, myalgias, and pain in both knees when walking. The eye redness had resolved, but there was mild soreness of the right eye. There was no headache, ear pain, difficulty swallowing, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or rash. The patient had a history of developmental dysplasia of the hip and was otherwise healthy. She had normal growth and development and had received all routine childhood vaccinations. Medications included amoxicillin, acetaminophen, ibuprofen, benzonatate, guaifenesin, and dextromethorphan. There were no known drug allergies. The patient was born in New England and lived in a suburban area of New England with her mother, father, and brother. She performed well in high school, which she was attending remotely because of the Covid-19 pandemic; she had no known sick contacts. She had traveled to a Caribbean island 1 year earlier. She was a vegetarian and did not drink alcohol, smoke tobacco, or use illicit drugs. Her parents and brother were healthy. On examination, the temperature was 38.5°C, the heart rate 124 beats per minute, the blood pressure 142/62 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 30 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 35.9. The patient appeared pale, and she coughed and sniffled frequently. She did not use accessory muscles while breathing, and breath sounds in the lower lung fields were decreased. There was no conjunctival injection, lymphadenopathy, joint swelling or tenderness, or rash; the remainder of the physical examination was normal. The creatinine level was 2.00 mg per deciliter (177 μmol per liter; reference range, 0.60 to 1.50 mg per deciliter [53 to 133 μmol per liter]) and the C-reactive protein level 77.5 mg per liter (reference value, <8.0). The hemoglobin level was 6.7 g per deciliter (reference range, 12.0 to 16.0), the hematocrit 21.1% (reference range, 36.0 to 46.0), the white-cell count 11,890 per microliter (reference range, 4500 to 13,000), and the platelet count 526,000 per microliter (reference range, 150,000 to 450,000). Urinalysis revealed 3+ blood and 2+ protein; microscopic examination of the urinary sediment revealed more than 100 red cells per high-power field (reference range, 0 to 2) and 10 to 20 white cells per high-power field (reference value, <10), as well as mixed granular casts and red-cell casts. Nucleic acid testing of a nasopharyngeal specimen for SARS-CoV-2, influenza types A and B, and respiratory syncytial virus was negative. An interferon-γ release assay for Mycobacterium tuberculosis was performed, and blood cultures were obtained. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Dr. Randheer Shailam: Chest radiography (Figure 1A and 1B) revealed prominent patchy opacities in the lower lung zones. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest (Figure 1C through 1F), performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed peripheral patchy ground-glass opacification with greater involvement of the lower lobes than of the upper lobes, the lingula (left lung), and the middle lobe (right lung). There were also areas of normal-appearing lung. These findings are not specific and can be seen with infectious causes such as bacterial pneumonia and Covid-19, as well as with noninfectious causes such as aspiration, pulmonary hemorrhage, and less likely, alveolar proteinosis. Dr. Martin: Ceftriaxone, azithromycin, and intravenous fluids were administered.

Case Study 9
Title: A 57-Year-Old Man with Persistent Cough and Pulmonary Opacities
Case Study:  Dr. George A. Alba: A 57-year-old man was evaluated at this hospital because of persistent cough and pulmonary opacities. Six years before the current admission, the patient received a diagnosis of polyarteritis nodosa after fevers, arthralgias, abdominal pain, and testicular pain had developed. He was treated with six cycles of cyclophosphamide, followed by maintenance therapy with prednisone and weekly methotrexate. He was treated intermittently with escalating doses of prednisone because of episodic worsening of the arthralgias; the most recent such treatment was given 5 months before the current admission. At that time, owing to an exacerbation of pain associated with the arthralgias and at the direction of his physician, he increased the amount of oxycodone he had been taking. He also reported fever and weight loss. Imaging studies were obtained. Dr. Jeanna M. Harvey Barnes: Five months before the current admission, computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material. Chest CT (Figure 1A and 1B) revealed mild centrilobular emphysema and small pulmonary nodules that appeared unchanged from those seen on imaging that had been performed 6 years earlier. There was also diffuse thickening of the bronchial wall, layering secretions in the trachea and right main-stem bronchus, a mildly patulous esophagus, and a small hiatal hernia. There were no clinically significant findings on imaging of the abdomen or pelvis. Dr. Alba: A test for Mycobacterium tuberculosis was negative. Serum protein electrophoresis results were normal, as was the IgG level. Three months before the current admission, the patient had fevers and a cough productive of green sputum. The temperature was 37.3°C and the oxygen saturation 89% while he was breathing ambient air. Thrush was present in the oropharynx. Auscultation of the chest revealed crackles and wheezing in the right lung. Blood levels of electrolytes, lipase, amylase, lactate dehydrogenase, and troponin T were normal, as were the results of liver-function and kidney-function tests; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Dr. Harvey Barnes: A chest radiograph (Figure 1C) showed patchy and confluent opacities predominantly in the right mid and lower lung. Dr. Alba: The patient was admitted to this hospital, and empirical treatment with intravenous vancomycin, cefepime, and levofloxacin was administered. A blood test for cryptococcal antigen and a urine test for legionella antigen were negative. A sputum culture grew normal respiratory flora and Candida albicans; a test for Pneumocystis jirovecii was negative. During the next several days, fever resolved and the oxygen saturation and white-cell count normalized. On the fifth hospital day, the patient was discharged home to complete a 14-day course of levofloxacin. After he completed the course of levofloxacin, his cough and constitutional symptoms abated partially but did not return to baseline. His primary care physician prescribed inhaled fluticasone–salmeterol and as-needed inhaled albuterol. Six weeks after the patient was discharged from this hospital (approximately 5 weeks before the current admission), his wife began to have a nonproductive cough and rhinorrhea; several days later, the patient had similar symptoms, along with increased production of brown sputum. He sought medical attention after awakening with coughing and dyspnea. The temperature was 38.4°C and the oxygen saturation 89% while he was breathing ambient air. Dr. Harvey Barnes: A chest radiograph (Figure 1D) obtained 1 month before the current admission showed patchy opacities in the right upper, middle, and lower lobes. Dr. Alba: Electrolyte levels were normal, as were the results of liver-function and kidney function tests; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. The patient was again admitted to this hospital, and empirical treatment with intravenous vancomycin, cefepime, and azithromycin; oral prednisone; and inhaled albuterol and ipratropium was administered. A sputum culture grew normal respiratory flora and C. albicans. After two days, the patient was discharged home to complete a 7-day course of levofloxacin. Over the course of the next 3 weeks, the patient had malaise, productive cough, fever, and sweats. He stopped smoking cigarettes. Eight days before the current admission, the patient was referred to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation. On examination, the temperature was 37.2°C and the oxygen saturation 94% while he was breathing ambient air. There were crackles in both lung bases and in the right middle lung field, with no wheezes. Blood levels of electrolytes and lactate dehydrogenase were normal, as were the results of liver-function and kidney-function tests and urinalysis; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Dr. Harvey Barnes: A chest radiograph (Figure 2A) showed multifocal reticulonodular and patchy opacities, which were confluent in the right lower lobe. CT of the chest (Figure 2B and 2C), performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed multifocal clustered, centrilobular nodules and opacities in a tree-in-bud pattern with scattered areas of focal consolidation that were present predominantly in the right middle and lower lobes. There was associated mild mediastinal and right hilar lymphadenopathy that had not been present on the previous chest CT examination. Dr. Alba: The patient was again admitted to this hospital, and additional testing was performed. Tests for antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies and anti–double-stranded DNA antibodies were negative, and blood levels of C3 and C4 were normal. A urine test for legionella antigen was negative. On the third hospital day, a bronchoscopy and a transbronchial biopsy were performed. The bronchoalveolar-lavage (BAL) fluid obtained from the right middle lobe was cloudy; analysis of the fluid revealed 888 nucleated cells per microliter (of which 48% were neutrophils and 2% were lymphocytes, with no eosinophils). Gram’s staining of the BAL fluid revealed neutrophils and sparse growth of gram-positive cocci. Staining for acid-fast organisms was negative; culture grew normal respiratory flora and C. albicans. Tests of the BAL fluid for influenza virus, adenovirus, parainfluenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, P. jirovecii, histoplasma antigen, and blastomyces antigen were negative, as were cultures for cytomegalovirus and herpes simplex virus. An interferon-γ release assay for M. tuberculosis was also negative. The patient was discharged home on the third hospital day, with follow-up scheduled in the pulmonary clinic for 3 weeks later. Four days after the patient was discharged, a BAL test for galactomannan returned a positive result (antigen index, ≥3.750; negative test, <0.5), and the patient was readmitted to this hospital. He reported ongoing dyspnea, cough with thick white sputum, and persistent fever with a temperature of up to 39.3°C. A review of systems was notable for diffuse chronic arthralgias, a bitter taste in the mouth, and intermittent dysphagia. There was no chest pain, edema, orthopnea, nausea, vomiting, jaundice, or rash, and he had no known current sick contacts. The weight was 5 kg lower than that recorded 1 year earlier. Medical history was notable for polyarteritis nodosa, deep venous thrombosis, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), pancreatitis in the context of choledocholithiasis, hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, osteopenia, and chronic neuropathic pain. Medications included aspirin, prednisone, methotrexate, trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole, folate supplementation, metformin, atenolol, simvastatin, pregabalin, and as-needed oxycodone, as well as inhaled fluticasone–salmeterol and albuterol as needed. Lisinopril had reportedly caused pancreatic inflammation; there were no other known adverse reactions to medications. The patient was of White European ancestry. He lived in New England with his wife and was retired from an office position. Three decades earlier, he had worked in a machine shop where solvents, fuels, and sulfur compounds were used but had had no known exposure to these agents. There was no history of exposure to mold, pets, or asbestos. He had received influenza and pneumococcal vaccines. He and his wife had traveled within the United States and to the Caribbean. He had smoked 1.5 packs of cigarettes per day for 30 years but had quit in the weeks before the current admission. He had previously smoked marijuana, rarely consumed alcohol, and never used other substances. There was no family history of autoimmune or pulmonary disease; his father had died from colorectal cancer, and his mother had had esophageal cancer and had died after a stroke. His three adult children were healthy. The temperature was 36.6°C, the heart rate 75 beats per minute, the blood pressure 135/69 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 28 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 91% while the patient was receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 6 liters per minute. He had a slightly cushingoid appearance and was tachypneic, although he was able to speak in full sentences. Auscultation of the chest revealed rales at the right lung base, rhonchi during both the inspiratory and expiratory phases that were more pronounced in the right lung than in the left lung, and intermittent inspiratory wheezing in the right lung. The rest of the examination was normal. Dr. Harvey Barnes: A chest radiograph (Figure 2D) showed progression of the diffuse bilateral reticulonodular opacities, with additional patchy opacities in the right lung and left lower lobe, as compared with the image obtained 1 week earlier. Dr. Alba: Blood levels of electrolytes, amylase, lipase, N-terminal pro–B-type natriuretic peptide, and troponin T were normal, as were the results of tests of kidney and liver function; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis was normal, and a urine test for legionella antigen was negative. The BAL-fluid culture obtained during the previous admission grew enterococcus species, C. albicans, and C. glabrata; no mycobacteria grew in any of three induced sputum samples obtained during the previous admission. Empirical treatment with intravenous voriconazole was initiated, and ongoing treatment with methotrexate was interrupted. Cytologic analysis of the BAL fluid and the transbronchial-biopsy specimen obtained during the previous admission revealed evidence of acute inflammation, bronchial columnar cells, and pulmonary macrophages. There were no malignant cells. Evaluation of the bronchial mucosa revealed no abnormalities. On the second hospital day, the temperature was 37.9°C and the oxygen saturation 91% while the patient was receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 5 liters per minute. Dr. Harvey Barnes: Repeat CT of the chest (Figure 2E and 2F) was performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material as part of a pulmonary embolism protocol. This imaging study revealed extensive centrilobular pulmonary nodules, opacities in a tree-in-bud pattern, and patchy ground-glass opacities. There was bronchial wall thickening with mucus plugging, predominantly affecting the lower lobes. There were additional areas of nodular consolidation that were more prominent in the right lung than in the left lung. These findings indicated a progression of disease as compared with the chest CT performed 1 week before the current admission. There was no evidence of pulmonary embolism. Dr. Alba: Additional induced sputum samples were obtained for culture; Gram’s staining revealed abundant neutrophils and abundant mixed gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. On the third hospital day, the temperature was 36.9°C and the oxygen saturation 96% while the patient was receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 3 liters per minute.

Case Study 10
Title: An 80-Year-Old Woman with Pancytopenia
Case Study:  Dr. Leontios Pappas (Medicine): An 80-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital because of pancytopenia and the identification of schistocytes on a peripheral-blood smear. Six weeks before admission to this hospital, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea developed, along with chills and subjective fever. The symptoms resolved after 4 days without specific intervention, but then intermittent dysphagia with solid foods and early satiety developed. During the next 4 weeks, the patient had gradually progressive fatigue and light-headedness. The fatigue progressed to the point that she could no longer stay at work for more than a few hours; she presented to another hospital for evaluation. At the other hospital, the patient reported that she had ongoing fatigue and had lost 6 kg of weight over a 5-week period. On examination, the temperature was 38.9°C, the weight 55.5 kg, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 21.9. Laboratory studies revealed pancytopenia, and examination of a peripheral-blood smear revealed schistocytes. Blood levels of glucose and electrolytes were normal, as were the results of kidney-function and liver-function tests; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Imaging studies were obtained. Dr. Ranjodh S. Dhami: A chest radiograph was normal. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous and oral contrast material, revealed a small hiatal hernia, multiple simple cysts in the right kidney, and indeterminate bilateral pelvic masses measuring 4.8 cm in diameter on the right side and 6.3 cm in diameter on the left side (Figure 1). Dr. Pappas: Intravenous fluids were administered, and the patient was admitted to the other hospital. On hospital day 2, the hemoglobin level decreased to 6.6 g per deciliter, and two units of packed red cells were transfused. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed diffuse esophageal inflammation with white exudates throughout the esophagus; examination of brushings revealed yeast consistent with candida, and treatment with fluconazole was initiated. During the next 3 hospital days, the patient continued to feel unwell, with persistent fever and limited oral intake due to odynophagia, and the administration of intravenous fluids was continued. Blood and urine cultures showed no growth. On hospital day 5, empirical therapy with doxycycline was started because of concerns about a possible tickborne illness. On hospital day 6, the oxygen saturation decreased to 89% while the patient was breathing ambient air and then increased to 94% when oxygen was delivered through a nasal cannula at a rate of 3 liters per minute. CT of the chest, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed ground-glass opacities and interlobular septal thickening, findings consistent with pulmonary edema, along with bilateral pleural effusions of a small to moderate size. The administration of intravenous fluids was stopped, and one dose of intravenous furosemide was provided. On hospital day 7, fever resolved but pancytopenia persisted. Examination of a peripheral-blood smear revealed a moderate amount of schistocytes, severe anisocytosis, large platelets, and an increased amount of bands without blasts. Direct and indirect Coombs’ tests were negative, as were nucleic acid tests for babesiosis and anaplasmosis. Blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, cobalamin, folate, homocysteine, and anticardiolipin IgG and IgM were normal, as were the results of kidney-function and liver-function tests. The results of serologic tests for Epstein–Barr virus were consistent with previous infection. Flow cytometry of the peripheral blood showed phenotypically normal myeloid cells; there was an increased amount of atypical CD34+ myeloblasts, which accounted for less than 1% of leukocytes and were of unclear clinical significance. A tunneled catheter was placed in the right internal jugular vein, and plasma exchange was initiated for the treatment of possible thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). Total parenteral nutrition was also initiated, because oral intake was still limited by odynophagia. On hospital day 8, oral intake of soft foods and liquids increased. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed normal left ventricular size and function, as well as a mildly thickened aortic valve with no stenosis or regurgitation; there was trace mitral and tricuspid regurgitation. On hospital day 9, the patient underwent additional plasma exchange and was transferred to this hospital for further care. On evaluation in this hospital, the patient reported that her energy level had increased. She recalled that she had felt mildly confused at the other hospital, but the confusion had since resolved. She had had no gum bleeding or blood in the stool or urine. Other medical history included hypertension and dyslipidemia. Surgical history included hysterectomy at 40 years of age, with no vaginal bleeding since the procedure. One year earlier, routine laboratory testing had revealed mild thrombocytopenia and anemia. A bone marrow biopsy performed at that time had revealed slightly hypercellular marrow with maturing trilineage hematopoiesis but with some erythroid abnormalities and occasional hyperchromatic megakaryocytes; cytogenetic analysis had shown a loss of chromosomes 3 and 5 and a gain of chromosome 8 in 65% of the cells. Thereafter, blood counts monitored every 4 months, including 4 months before this presentation, had remained stable; laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Medications included amlodipine, atorvastatin, and hydrochlorothiazide. There were no known drug allergies. The patient drank alcohol occasionally and did not use illicit drugs. She had smoked tobacco for 50 years but had quit 5 years before this presentation. She was widowed and lived alone in New England; her work involved cleaning a church several days a week. Her sister had had breast cancer at 30 years of age, and a brother had had testicular cancer at a young age and liver cancer at 55 years of age. On examination, the temperature was 36.8°C, the blood pressure 150/65 mm Hg, the pulse 72 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while oxygen was administered through a nasal cannula at a rate of 2 liters per minute. The patient was alert and oriented, and she did not appear ill. There were no petechiae. There was no bleeding at the site of tunneled catheter placement in the right internal jugular vein. The first and second heart sounds were normal; a grade 2/6 systolic murmur was heard at the left lower sternal border. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. Examination of a peripheral-blood smear revealed schistocytes, anisocytosis, and a low platelet count, with large platelets present; the white cells appeared normal, and there were no blasts (Figure 2). The results of serum protein electrophoresis were normal. The levels of serum free kappa and lambda light chains were increased, with a normal ratio. Screening for human immunodeficiency virus infection was negative. Urinalysis showed 2+ urobilinogen, without bilirubin, blood, glucose, ketones, protein, or nitrates; the specific gravity and pH were normal. Consultation was obtained from the gynecology service regarding the bilateral pelvic masses noted on CT of the abdomen and pelvis. Blood levels of CA 125, CA 19-9, and carcinoembryonic antigen were normal, and follow-up in the gynecology clinic was recommended for further evaluation after discharge. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.

Case Study 11
Title: A 65-Year-Old Woman with Depression, Recurrent Falls, and Inability to Care for Herself
Case Study:  Diana L. Stern (Psychiatry): A 65-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital because of depression, recurrent falls, and difficulty caring for herself. Four years before the current admission, the patient received a diagnosis of depression that was precipitated by psychosocial stressors. She was treated with bupropion, citalopram, and cognitive behavioral therapy. The depression was well controlled until 1 year before the current admission, when she began to have anhedonia, decreased energy, sadness, and poor concentration. She resumed cognitive behavioral therapy, but her symptoms worsened during the next 4 months, and she had suicidal ideation. The dose of bupropion was increased, and treatment with trazodone was started. Fourteen weeks before the current admission, the patient was in a motor vehicle accident that was attributed to her falling asleep while driving. After the accident, she reported increased sadness, low energy, and inability to perform her usual activities. One week later, she fell and struck her head, and she was evaluated in the emergency department of this hospital. She reported that, before her fall, she had been feeling unsteady because of weakness in the left leg. A physical examination was normal. Computed tomography (CT) of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed hypodensities involving the subcortical and periventricular white matter, findings consistent with chronic small-vessel disease. The patient was referred to the neurology clinic of this hospital and was discharged home. During the next week, the patient had balance difficulties and began using a walker. When she was evaluated in the neurology clinic, she reported imbalance and occasional nausea. On examination, she had a depressed affect. Strength was assessed as 5−/5 in the proximal and distal muscles of the arms and legs. Reflexes were 1+ and symmetric at the biceps, triceps, and patellar tendons and were absent at the ankles, with downgoing toes. The gait was wide-based and unsteady, with mild dragging of the left leg. A diagnosis of postconcussive syndrome was considered, and treatment with ondansetron was started for nausea. Additional tests were performed. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed increased signal intensity in the pons and in a periventricular distribution on T2-weighted imaging, without associated contrast enhancement. There was a region of decreased signal intensity in the right corona radiata on a map of the apparent diffusion coefficient. Results of electroencephalography were normal, as were results of electromyography and nerve-conduction studies of the left leg. Physical therapy was recommended, and repeat MRI was planned for 6 weeks later. Over the next 6-week period, during sessions of cognitive behavioral therapy, the patient was noted to be less talkative, with slow processing, impaired recall, and mild inattention. Repeat MRI with angiography performed 6 weeks after the first study revealed patchy hyperintensity involving the centrum semiovale, corona radiata, internal capsule, and corticospinal tract bilaterally on T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) imaging, without contrast enhancement; the cerebral vasculature was normal. The patient had recurrent falls without loss of consciousness and began using a wheelchair. She reported worsening sadness, anxiety, and anhedonia, and treatment with buspirone was started. On evaluation in the neurology clinic 6 weeks before the current admission, testing of leg strength yielded inconsistent results, but strength in both legs was assessed as 5−/5 with maximum effort. Dragging of the left leg was also noted to be inconsistent. There were concerns that her depression might be contributing to her neurologic changes, and further follow-up with the psychiatric service was recommended. Five weeks before the current admission, the patient’s husband brought her to the emergency department of this hospital for an evaluation of worsening memory impairment, poor self-care, and frequent falls. The patient had stopped participating in physical therapy and was spending most of the day in bed. She reported that she had lost 14 kg during the previous 4 months. Other medical history included hypertension, diabetes, and osteoarthritis of the knees. There was a history of postpartum depression 27 years earlier that had lasted for several months. Medications included amlodipine, buspirone, bupropion, cholecalciferol, citalopram, metformin, and trazodone. There were no known drug allergies. The patient lived with her husband in a suburb of Boston and worked as a teacher. She was a lifelong nonsmoker, drank alcohol only occasionally, and did not use illicit drugs. Her mother had a history of anxiety and depression in her seventh decade of life. Her sister had a history of stroke. On examination, the patient appeared tired and disheveled, with psychomotor retardation. Strength in both legs was assessed as 5/5. She had a monoplegic gait, with buckling of the left leg, when walking down a hallway, but she had a normal gait when walking on a treadmill. Her score on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment was 25, indicating mild cognitive impairment; scores range from 0 to 30, with higher scores indicating better cognitive function. The complete blood count, results of liver-function and kidney-function tests, and blood levels of cobalamin, thyrotropin, and electrolytes were normal. Screening for syphilis, Lyme disease, and the human immunodeficiency virus was negative, as was urine toxicologic screening. After an evaluation by a neurology consultant, the patient was voluntarily admitted to the inpatient psychiatric unit. While the patient was in the hospital, the dose of citalopram was tapered, and treatment with desvenlafaxine and amphetamine–dextroamphetamine was started; her levels of attention and wakefulness increased. She participated in group psychotherapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, and occupational and physical therapy. She continued to have variable weakness in the left leg and had three witnessed falls, during which she reportedly had fatigue and lowered herself to the ground. On hospital day 11, the patient reported being unable to use her left arm because of weakness. Although her left arm rested across her chest for most of the day, she was observed holding her husband’s hand with her left hand when saying goodbye. On evaluation by a neurology consultant, strength in the left arm was assessed as 5/5. The working diagnosis was functional neurologic disorder. On hospital day 12, the patient was discharged to a rehabilitation center. At the rehabilitation center, the patient received physical, occupational, and speech therapy, as well as medications to treat depression. During the first week, she made progress toward independence in bathing, toileting, and grooming but had limited attention, memory, and problem solving. During the second week, she became more withdrawn. There was a paucity of speech with hypophonia, decreased attention, and less eye contact with visitors who sat on her left side than with visitors who sat on her right side. During the third week, the patient stopped answering questions and following commands. She was evaluated again in the emergency department of this hospital. On examination, the temperature was 36.7°C, the blood pressure 141/90 mm Hg, the pulse 98 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air. She was withdrawn and minimally interactive. She was able to state her name but not the date or location. She did not blink in response to threat on the left side and did not track the examiner’s finger past the midline to the left. There was flattening of the left nasolabial fold. The left arm was hypertonic and held in flexion; there was no spontaneous movement of the left arm or leg, and she declined to participate in a strength examination. She did not withdraw the left arm in response to nail-bed pressure; she withdrew the left foot with antigravity movement in response to tactile stimulation. The white-cell count was 12,940 per microliter (reference range, 4500 to 11,000), with a normal differential count. The remainder of the complete blood count was normal, as were the results of liver-function and kidney-function tests and blood levels of electrolytes.

Case Study 12
Title: A 14-Year-Old Boy with Fever, Joint Pain, and Abdominal Cramping
Case Study:  Dr. Micaela Atkins (Pediatrics): A 14-year-old boy was admitted to this hospital because of fatigue, fever, joint pain, abdominal cramping, and diarrhea. The patient had been well until 2 weeks before this admission, when fatigue and fever developed on his final day of summer camp. He was taken to the primary care clinic at another hospital and was told that he had a viral infection. Nine days before this admission, new mild sore throat developed, and the patient returned to the primary care clinic. A throat culture for group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus was reportedly negative. The patient was told that he had possible sinusitis, and treatment with amoxicillin–clavulanate was started. During the next 3 days, the sore throat abated, but fatigue and fever persisted. Six days before this admission, new pain in the right shoulder and left knee developed, and the patient again returned to the primary care clinic. The white-cell count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were reportedly elevated; a blood test for Lyme disease was performed. On the day of admission, the joint pain progressed to involve the shoulders and knees on both sides, and the temperature increased to 39.4°C. The patient was given ibuprofen and brought to the emergency department at this hospital. On evaluation, the patient described aching pain in the shoulders and knees, which was worst in his right shoulder and left knee. He rated the pain at 7 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain. He had not noticed redness, swelling, or stiffness of the joints. A review of systems was notable for chills, intermittent night sweats, headache, myalgias, and lightheadedness when he stood up from a sitting position. He had no weight loss, rash, vision changes, or respiratory symptoms. He had mild abdominal cramping, decreased appetite, and intermittent nausea. During the past week, there had been a few episodes of nonbloody emesis and watery diarrhea. There had been no hematemesis, hematochezia, or melena. The patient had autism spectrum disorder, with an early delay in speech development that had resolved after speech therapy. He had met milestones for gross and fine motor skills and growth. He had reportedly received all routine childhood vaccinations. Other history included asthma, seasonal rhinosinusitis, and allergies to peanuts and tree nuts; there were no known drug allergies. He had undergone a tonsillectomy in early childhood. Medications included amoxicillin–clavulanate, inhaled fluticasone, and ibuprofen and inhaled albuterol as needed. At the time of admission, the patient was on his summer break before entering high school. Earlier in the summer, he had gone on vacation to a coastal area of New England. He had also attended camp in a rural area of New England, where he camped and hiked in wooded areas and swam in fresh water. He had seen a tick on his clothing but did not recall any bites. Two weeks before this admission, the patient had returned to his home in a suburban area of New England, where he lived with his mother (who was a veterinarian), father, sister, and pet dog. His sister had recently had an acute gastrointestinal illness that resolved after several days. The patient was not sexually active and did not use alcohol, drugs, or tobacco. His mother had hypothyroidism, and his maternal uncle had rheumatoid arthritis; there was no other known family history of autoimmune diseases. On examination, the temperature was 36.1°C, the blood pressure 128/58 mm Hg, the heart rate 107 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 27.2. The patient appeared to be well developed and well nourished, but he looked tired. The conjunctivae were normal. The mucous membranes were dry, and there was an aphthous ulcer on the right buccal mucosa. The lungs were clear on auscultation. There was tenderness on palpation of the epigastric and periumbilical abdomen. There was no erythema, warmth, swelling, or crepitus of the large and small joints. There was tenderness on palpation, as well as pain with movement, of the right shoulder and knees; range of motion in these joints was not decreased. The patient had no rash or lymphadenopathy. The white-cell count was 12,950 per microliter (reference range, 4500 to 13,000), the erythrocyte sedimentation rate 48 mm per hour (reference range, 0 to 13), the C-reactive protein level 207.6 mg per liter (reference range, 0.0 to 8.0), and the lipase level 82 U per liter (reference range, 13 to 60). Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. While the patient was in the emergency department, the temperature increased to 39.2°C. Intravenous fluids were administered, and empirical treatment with doxycycline was started. The patient was admitted to the hospital. During the next 2 days, the fever resolved, but the joint pain, abdominal cramping, and diarrhea worsened in severity. On the third hospital day, fever recurred. The white-cell count was 15,190 per microliter, the C-reactive protein level 178.3 mg per liter, and the lipase level 145 U per liter. A fecal occult blood test was positive. A plain film of the right shoulder was normal.

Case Study 13
Title: A 22-Year-Old Man with Pain and Erythema of the Left Hand
Case Study:  Dr. Marisa L. Winkler: A 22-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of pain and rapidly spreading erythema of the left hand. The patient had been well until the day of admission, when he awoke with pain and swelling of the left hand that involved the distal interphalangeal joint of the second finger and the proximal interphalangeal joint of the fourth finger. Over a period of several hours, the pain progressed and bullae began to form. He began to have pain with movement of the second and fourth fingers, and the bullae turned dark purple; these changes prompted the patient to present to the emergency department of this hospital. In the emergency department, the patient reported pain of the left hand that worsened with movement of the second and fourth fingers. There was no lethargy, fatigue, headache, dyspnea, cough, or pain elsewhere. The patient had no notable medical history and had been well before the day of presentation. On examination, the patient appeared well. The temperature was 38.6°C, the blood pressure 126/63 mm Hg, the heart rate 101 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while he was breathing ambient air. There were two violaceous, tender bullae on the dorsal aspect of the left hand — one on the distal interphalangeal joint of the second finger and one on the proximal interphalangeal joint of the fourth finger, each measuring 7 mm by 3 mm (Figure 1). In addition, there was nontender, streaking erythema spreading across the dorsal aspect of the left hand, the volar aspect of the left forearm, and the medial aspect of the left upper arm into the axilla. There was no axillary lymphadenopathy. On further examination of the left arm, the soft-tissue compartments were soft and compressible, without evidence of crepitus. Finger flexion and extension were intact but limited by pain and swelling in the second and fourth fingers. Results of motor and sensory examinations were normal. The hand was warm. The radial pulse was palpable, and the capillary refill was brisk. The remainder of the overall physical examination was unremarkable. A blood specimen was obtained for culture, a complete blood count, and a metabolic panel. Initial laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Dr. Arvin Kheterpal: Computed tomography (CT) of the left hand and arm, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed focal soft-tissue swelling overlying the distal interphalangeal joint of the second finger and the proximal interphalangeal joint of the fourth finger on the dorsal aspect of the left hand (Figure 2). There was no evidence of osseous erosion, periosteal reaction, fracture, joint effusion, fluid collection, or subcutaneous air. The left forearm had a normal appearance on imaging. Dr. Winkler: While the patient was in the emergency department, additional history was obtained. The patient was not taking any medications and had no known allergies to medications. He had recently graduated from college and was seeking employment. He lived with his parents in a suburban area of New England. There was no history of recent travel or sick contacts. He rarely drank alcohol and did not smoke cigarettes or use illicit drugs. There was no notable family history. The patient had recently begun practicing taxidermy as a new hobby. Four days before presentation, he received a frozen deer hide from a friend, which he began to prepare for tanning. When he first received the deer hide, he scraped the skin and fur to remove numerous ticks. On the day before presentation, he kneaded the hide with his hands and massaged into it a mixture of deer brain and tap water that had been prepared the day before and left to stand overnight. While the patient was working with the animal hide, he did not wear protective clothing or gloves. His mother had assisted in part of the process but remained well. Intravenous fluid, ceftriaxone, and vancomycin were administered, and the patient was admitted to the hospital. Consultants from the orthopedic hand service, dermatology, and infectious diseases evaluated the patient.

Case Study 14
Title: A 48-Year-Old Man with Fatigue and Leg Swelling
Case Study:  Dr. Jonathan R. Wing: A 48-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of fatigue and swelling in both legs. The patient had been well until 8 months before the current admission, when fatigue and lethargy developed. He thought the fatigue was associated with alcohol consumption and reduced his intake to 12 beers weekly; before this, he had consumed 24 beers weekly for 15 years. Three months before the current admission, the patient’s weight had decreased by 9.1 kg. However, 3 weeks before this admission, the weight had increased by 9.6 kg and swelling developed in both legs. He thought the weight gain was related to diet changes, including consumption of pizza, pasta, and soup, during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. One week before the current admission, the patient was evaluated by his primary care physician. He was instructed to elevate his legs, wear compression stockings, and decrease dietary sodium to 2 g daily. On the day of the current admission, the leg swelling had not abated and new abdominal distention occurred. He called the primary care clinic and was instructed to seek evaluation at the emergency department of this hospital. On evaluation, a review of systems was notable for fatigue, lethargy, decreased appetite, abdominal bloating, constipation, penile swelling, decreased libido, intolerance of cold temperatures, and ankle and knee pain in both legs that was worse when the patient was climbing stairs. There was no fever, shortness of breath, chest pain, or hematochezia. Sixteen months before the current evaluation, the patient had been admitted to this hospital with pneumonia involving the right upper and middle lobes that was due to Mycoplasma pneumoniae. During that admission, he received diagnoses of diabetes and normocytic anemia. After discharge from the hospital, laboratory evaluation revealed a glycated hemoglobin level of 6.1% (reference range, 4.3 to 6.4). Metformin was prescribed, and follow-up evaluation was recommended; however, the patient had not returned to the primary care clinic before the current illness. The patient had not started taking metformin until 3 weeks before the current evaluation; he took no other medications and had no known drug allergies. He lived with his wife and two children in an urban area of New England. He did not smoke tobacco or use illicit drugs. His mother had Parkinson’s disease and dementia; he did not know the health of his father or paternal half-siblings. On examination, the temperature was 36.6°C, the blood pressure 98/54 mm Hg, the heart rate 64 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 27.3. The patient did not have jaundice, scleral icterus, or spider angiomas. He had jugular venous distention and an S3 gallop; there were no rales. The abdomen was distended, with dullness on percussion of the flanks; there was no hepatosplenomegaly. There was 2+ symmetric pitting edema in the lower legs up to the knees. Mild palmar erythema was present; there was no asterixis. The blood glucose level was 402 mg per deciliter (22.3 mmol per liter; reference range, 70 to 110 mg per deciliter [3.9 to 6.1 mmol per liter]); the glycated hemoglobin level was 11.6%. The platelet count was 82,000 per microliter (reference range, 150,000 to 400,000). Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Dr. Reece J. Goiffon: Radiography of the chest revealed new elevation of the right hemidiaphragm and atelectasis in the lower lobes. Ultrasonography with Doppler analysis of the abdomen revealed mild thickening of the gallbladder wall, coarsened liver echotexture, moderate ascites, and mild splenomegaly; the portal veins were patent. Duplex ultrasonography revealed nonocclusive deep-vein thrombosis of the right popliteal vein. Dr. Wing: Paracentesis was performed with ultrasonographic guidance, and 50 ml of peritoneal fluid was drained. Results of peritoneal fluid analysis are shown in Table 1; cytologic examination of the fluid revealed no malignant cells. Electrocardiography revealed normal sinus rhythm with occasional premature atrial complexes, left axis deviation, and T-wave inversions in leads I and aVL. Insulin and enoxaparin were administered subcutaneously, and the patient was admitted to the hospital.

Case Study 15
Title: A 19-Year-Old Man with Shock, Multiple Organ Failure, and Rash
Case Study:  Dr. Alexandra T. Lucas (Pediatrics): A 19-year-old man was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) of this hospital because of shock, multiple organ failure, and rash. The patient had been well until 20 hours before this admission, when diffuse abdominal pain and nausea developed after he ate rice, chicken, and lo mein leftovers from a restaurant meal. Multiple episodes of emesis occurred, with vomitus that was either bilious or red-brown. The abdominal pain and vomiting were followed by the development of chills, generalized weakness, progressively worsening diffuse myalgias, chest pain, shortness of breath, headache, neck stiffness, and blurry vision. Five hours before this admission, purplish discoloration of the skin developed, and a friend took the patient to the emergency department of another hospital for evaluation. On arrival at the emergency department of the other hospital, 4.5 hours before this admission, the patient reported diffuse myalgias that he rated at 8 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain. On examination, he appeared pale, anxious, and moderately distressed; he answered questions appropriately and was oriented to person, place, time, and situation. The temperature was 37.4°C, the pulse 147 beats per minute, the blood pressure 154/124 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while he was breathing ambient air. The oral mucous membranes were dry. On auscultation of the heart, tachycardia was present with a regular rhythm. The radial pulses were normal. The lungs were clear, without crackles, rhonchi, or wheezes. The abdomen was soft and nondistended, without tenderness; the patient vomited yellow-green material during the examination. The skin was warm and dry and had a mottled appearance. Blood specimens were obtained and sent to the laboratory for culture, a complete blood count, and tests of renal function, liver function, and coagulation, as well as measurement of levels of electrolytes, glucose, lipase, lactic acid, and troponin. A urine specimen was sent for urinalysis and culture, and a nasopharyngeal swab was obtained for influenza virus nucleic acid testing. Approximately 40 minutes after the patient’s arrival at the other hospital, ondansetron, ceftriaxone, and a 2-liter bolus of 0.90% normal saline were administered intravenously. During the next 30 minutes, tachypnea worsened and labored breathing, hypoxemia, and cyanosis developed. Supplemental oxygen was administered through a nonrebreather face mask, resulting in an oxygen saturation of 83%; then, oxygen was administered through a high-flow nasal cannula at a rate of 40 liters per minute. Intravenous doses of dexamethasone and vancomycin were given. During the following 40 minutes, the systolic blood pressure fell to 70 mm Hg and the dorsalis pedis pulses were noted to be weak. Approximately 110 minutes after the patient’s arrival at the other hospital, a triple-lumen central venous catheter was placed in the right femoral vein and a continuous intravenous infusion of norepinephrine was initiated. After intravenous doses of midazolam, etomidate, and fentanyl were administered, tracheal intubation was performed and mechanical ventilation with pressure-regulated volume control was begun, with a tidal volume of 6 ml per kilogram of body weight, a rate of 24 breaths per minute, a positive end-expiratory pressure of 10 cm of water, and a fraction of inspired oxygen (Fio2) of 100%. A continuous infusion of propofol was begun. Hypotension persisted, and a diffuse purpuric rash developed. Approximately 2 hours after the patient’s arrival at the other hospital, a dose of piperacillin–tazobactam was administered, a 1-liter bolus of 0.45% normal saline with 150 meq of sodium bicarbonate was given, and a Foley catheter was inserted. Twenty minutes later, a continuous intravenous infusion of phenylephrine was added, followed 7 minutes later by a vasopressin infusion. The patient was transported by helicopter to the PICU of this hospital. On the patient’s admission to this hospital, additional history was obtained from family members. A friend who had eaten the same meal as the patient the evening before admission had vomited once shortly thereafter but had not become progressively ill. The patient had a history of anxiety and depression, as well as intermittent ear infections during childhood. He had no known drug allergies. He had reportedly received all routine childhood vaccinations. He smoked two packs of cigarettes weekly, smoked marijuana daily, and drank two alcoholic beverages approximately 2 times per week. He used dextromethorphan and diphenhydramine recreationally but did not use other illicit drugs. The patient lived in northern New England with his mother, brother, and three cats but had been staying with a friend for 5 days before admission, during which time he had visited a beach along the ocean and a music venue. He worked part-time at a restaurant; he had not traveled recently or had any other exposure to animals or ill persons. His father had coronary artery disease, his mother had hypothyroidism, and his brother had had viral meningitis at 6 weeks of age. On examination, the patient was pharmacologically sedated. The temperature was 40.8°C, the pulse 166 beats per minute, the blood pressure 120/53 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 28 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 95% while he was receiving mechanical ventilation with an Fio2 of 50%. He opened his eyes occasionally. The pupils were equal and reactive to light. The femoral pulses were palpable, but the peripheral pulses were not palpable and the digits were cold. There was diffuse anasarca and oozing from venipuncture sites and from the site of central venous catheter insertion. A diffuse reticular purpuric rash was present on the face, chest, abdomen, back, arms, and legs, sparing the palms and soles (Figure 1). A Foley catheter was in place, without urine output. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Chest radiography revealed perihilar airspace and diffuse interstitial opacities and bilateral small, layering pleural effusions. Dr. Manuella Lahoud-Rahme: A transthoracic echocardiogram was obtained while the patient was receiving norepinephrine, epinephrine, and vasopressin. The left ventricle had moderate dysfunction with regional wall-motion abnormalities; septal motion was decreased, but apical motion appeared to be preserved. The right ventricle had mild-to-moderate dysfunction with underfilling. There was no pericardial effusion.

Case Study 16
Title: A 48-Year-Old Man with Transient Vision Loss
Case Study:  Dr. Naomi J. Serling-Boyd (Medicine): A 48-year-old man was evaluated at this hospital because of transient vision loss. The patient had been in his usual state of good health until 1 hour before evaluation, when he noticed white “sparkles” flickering in the vision of the left eye, followed by sudden blurriness. He had no floaters or eye pain. During the next 2 minutes, the blurry vision worsened and became “dark,” such that the patient could not see a hand in front of his face when he covered the right eye. He presented to this hospital for evaluation, arriving 1 hour after the onset of vision symptoms. On presentation, the patient noted that the vision in the left eye was improving but remained blurry. The temperature was 36.7°C, the blood pressure 120/65 mm Hg, the heart rate 92 beats per minute, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 24.2. Visual acuity was 20/20 in the right eye and was limited to hand motions at 0.9 m (3.0 ft) in the left eye; 2 hours later, visual acuity in the left eye was 20/40 for distance vision and 20/30 with correction for near vision. Results of the Ishihara color test were normal. The pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light, with no relative afferent pupillary defect. Extraocular movements were intact; visual fields were full in response to confrontation. Intraocular pressure and results of a slit-lamp examination of the anterior and posterior segments of the eye were normal bilaterally. There was severe ptosis of the left upper eyelid (margin reflex distance, 4 mm in the right eye and 1 mm in the left eye). A dilated fundus examination revealed normal optic disks, maculae, and vessels. A nontender, irregular mass was palpable under the left superior orbital rim, but there was no proptosis. The temporal arteries were prominent bilaterally, more so on the right side than on the left side, with normal pulsations and no tenderness. There was no tenderness of the scalp or temporomandibular joints. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. A review of systems was notable for fatigue and weight loss of 4.5 kg in the past year, which the patient attributed to inactivity and decreased appetite. There was a 2-month history of bilateral jaw pain with chewing of firm foods but not with soft foods. There was lateral hip soreness in both hips after walking but no stiffness. There was a sensation of locking when flexing or extending the right first finger. Two days before evaluation, the patient had a temporal headache on the right side that resolved. He reported no numbness or weakness. The patient had a history of presbyopia. He had not undergone any surgeries, was not currently taking any medications, and had no known allergies. He was born and raised in a country in Eurasia and had lived in the United States for 20 years. He traveled internationally for his work as a university professor. He was divorced and lived with his two children in a house in New England. He had smoked a half pack of cigarettes for 5 years but had quit smoking 20 years earlier. He drank alcohol rarely and did not use illicit drugs. His parents were alive and well, both of his grandmothers had had breast cancer, and there was no family history of ocular or autoimmune disease. Laboratory evaluation revealed normocytic anemia and elevated levels of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and alkaline phosphatase. Results of tests of kidney and thyroid function were normal, as were blood levels of electrolytes, calcium, glucose, glycated hemoglobin, creatine kinase, homocysteine, and lipoprotein(a). Testing for antinuclear antibodies was negative, and levels of IgG subclasses were normal. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Aspirin was administered, along with empirical treatment with intravenous methylprednisolone, and the patient was admitted to the hospital. Dr. Hillary R. Kelly: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head and orbits (Figure 1), performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed enlargement of the right medial rectus muscle with stranding of the adjacent extraconal fat, as well as an enhancing masslike lesion in the left anterior superior orbit, abutting the left lacrimal gland. The masslike lesion showed a hypointense signal on short-tau inversion recovery imaging. The brain parenchyma was normal. Magnetic resonance angiography of the head and neck was normal, as was ultrasonography of the temporal arteries. Ultrasonography of the abdomen revealed markedly heterogeneous liver parenchyma and an enlarged periportal lymph node, measuring 2 cm in largest dimension. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis (Figure 1), performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed multiple punctate calcifications throughout the liver and hypoattenuation of the right hepatic lobe, as well as diffuse coalescent mesenteric and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy with coarse calcifications. There was a prominent right hilar lymph node, measuring 10 mm in diameter. The lung parenchyma was unremarkable. Dr. Serling-Boyd: On the second hospital day, diplopia occurred when the patient looked to the far right. On examination, there was mild limitation of abduction of the right eye. After a second dose of intravenous methylprednisolone was administered, the patient chose to leave the hospital against medical advice. After discharge, he took prednisone daily. During the next week, additional laboratory test results became available. Testing for antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCAs) was negative. Blood testing for blastomyces antigen, coccidioides antibodies, and histoplasma antibodies was negative, as was an interferon-γ release assay for Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

Case Study 17
Title: A 29-Month-Old Boy with Seizure and Hypocalcemia
Case Study:  Dr. Neil D. Fernandes: A 29-month-old boy was transferred to this hospital because of a seizure and hypocalcemia. Approximately 2 months before the current evaluation, the patient had a febrile seizure associated with an acute viral illness. After the seizure, his mother reported that his “waddling” gait had become more pronounced. Two weeks before the current evaluation, the patient was seen in the orthopedic clinic at another hospital. On examination, the cover-up test — in which the distal lower leg is covered and the alignment of the proximal lower leg is compared with that of the upper leg — was negative, a finding consistent with physiologic bowing of the leg. There was a pes planus (flatfoot) deformity that resolved when the patient was not bearing weight on the foot, and there was an external (positive) foot progression angle with ambulation. The mother was counseled that the findings were within the normal range for gait and musculoskeletal development. One day before the current evaluation, the mother noticed that the child’s legs “locked up” and appeared “shaky” when he was walking over a threshold. On the morning of the current evaluation, the patient’s mother noticed that the child was grunting while sleeping, with his eyes rolled upward and his arms stiffened and flexed. After less than 1 minute, the grunting and movements stopped and the patient vomited. Emergency medical services were called, and the patient was transported to the emergency department of another hospital. Vital signs, mental status, and findings on physical examination were reportedly normal. Laboratory evaluation was notable for a blood calcium level of 5.0 mg per deciliter (1.25 mmol per liter; reference range, 8.5 to 10.5 mg per deciliter [2.12 to 2.62 mmol per liter]). Intravenous calcium gluconate was administered. The patient was transferred to the emergency department of this hospital, arriving approximately 18 hours after a presumed seizure. Further history was obtained from the patient’s parents. The patient had been delivered at full term and had reportedly met developmental milestones for his age. His medical history was notable for atopic dermatitis, which had been diagnosed when he was 9 weeks of age, as well as multiple environmental and food allergies. One year earlier, evaluation by an allergist had revealed elevated levels on IgE tests specific to food allergens (milk, cashews, pistachios, egg whites, almonds, soybeans, chickpeas, green peas, lentils, peanuts, and sesame seeds) and environmental allergens (dogs, cats, and dust mites), although the patient later underwent food challenges to peanuts, legumes, almonds, and sesame seeds in an allergy clinic and had no symptoms. There were no known drug allergies. The patient had received diphenhydramine, hydroxyzine, epinephrine, and topical betamethasone as needed. He had not received any routine childhood vaccinations because of his parents’ refusal. The patient lived with his mother, father, two older siblings, and dog in New England. Although the mother was a vegetarian, she occasionally included chicken in the patient’s “natural” and organic diet. The patient’s mother had obsessive–compulsive disorder and anxiety, and his father had oral allergy syndrome and a history of varus knee deformity in childhood. The patient’s two siblings had atopic dermatitis, environmental allergies, and food allergies. There was no family history of seizure. On physical examination, the patient appeared well and was alert and interactive. The temperature was 36.9°C, the height 83.5 cm (3rd percentile for his age), and the weight 12.4 kg (24th percentile for his age). The blood pressure was 95/63 mm Hg, the pulse 114 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air. Muscle spasms occurred in the arms and legs with passive movement. Chvostek’s sign (contraction of the facial muscles) was not elicited after tapping on the region of the facial nerve anterior to the external auditory canal; Trousseau’s sign (carpal spasm) was not elicited after exertion of pressure from inflation of a sphygmomanometer on the upper arm. Muscle power, bulk, tone, and deep-tendon reflexes were normal, as was the remainder of the examination. The blood calcium level was 5.6 mg per deciliter (1.40 mmol per liter), the ionized calcium level 0.88 mmol per liter (reference range, 1.14 to 1.30), and the alkaline phosphatase level 673 U per liter (reference range, 142 to 335). Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. The patient was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit. Dr. Ruth Lim: Radiographs of the knees (Figure 1A and 1B) showed several abnormalities that affected the knees symmetrically. The bones were diffusely radiolucent with thinned cortexes; these features suggest generalized demineralization. No acute or healing fracture was detected. The metaphyses of the distal femur and the proximal tibia had a widened, flared contour bilaterally; in addition, the medial aspect of the proximal tibial metaphysis showed a beaked (pointed) contour bilaterally. The zone of provisional calcification — the area located between the metaphysis and the radiolucent primary growth plate (physis), where chondrocytes are responsible for longitudinal growth of long bones — was frayed in appearance, with focal areas of cupping (concavity). The radiolucent physes were abnormally widened in the distal femur and the proximal tibia bilaterally. Because abnormalities were observed on radiographs of the knees, a previously acquired chest radiograph (Figure 1C) was reviewed again for more information. There were subtle findings, including flaring and cupping of the metaphysis of the right proximal humerus and mild flaring of the anterior ends of the ribs.

Case Study 18
Title: A 63-Year-Old Man with Confusion, Fatigue, and Garbled Speech
Case Study:  Dr. Kevin L. Ard: A 63-year-old man was evaluated at this hospital in the spring because of fever, confusion, headache, garbled speech, fatigue, vision changes, lymphocytic pleocytosis, and an elevated protein level in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Approximately 5 years before the current presentation, the patient had received a diagnosis of primary membranous nephropathy at another hospital. Treatment with oral prednisone and cyclosporine was initiated. Two years later, the patient was referred to the nephrology clinic of this hospital for worsening proteinuria and hypertension; rituximab, prednisone, and cyclophosphamide were administered. During the next 21 months, he received four doses of rituximab, the last of which was administered 3 months before this presentation. Three months before this presentation, the patient had a flash of light accompanied by transient sharp pain in the left retro-orbital area and forehead, with monocular blurry vision. He was subsequently evaluated at the other hospital. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) of the head were normal. Intravenous normal saline was administered, and he was discharged. One week later, the patient was reevaluated at the same hospital for an episode of garbled and nonsensical speech with impaired comprehension that resolved after 10 minutes. A CT angiogram and an MRI of the head reportedly showed a subacute infarct in the right side of the pons; intravenous alteplase was administered. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) was normal. Mild word-finding difficulties and confusion persisted. After discharge, the patient had worsening vision with floaters in the left eye, headache, photophobia, sonophobia, and fatigue. Three weeks later, he was evaluated by a neuro-ophthalmologist, who prescribed oral butalbital–acetaminophen–caffeine therapy and ophthalmic prednisolone drops for suspected uveitis. The vision improved, and headaches decreased during the subsequent 2 weeks; however, 1 week later, he was readmitted to the other hospital with sudden onset of weakness on the right side, facial droop, and garbled speech. The weakness resolved after 10 minutes. CT and MRI of the head and TTE were reportedly unchanged from the previous imaging studies. An electroencephalogram (EEG) showed focal left temporal slowing, and treatment with levetiracetam was initiated. The garbled speech resolved after 2 days, and he was discharged from the hospital. During the next week, the patient had recurrent staring spells that lasted for 1 minute, during which his family thought he appeared “vacant”; low-grade fever also developed, and within 48 hours, the temperature increased to 39.4°C and the garbled speech recurred. He was readmitted to the other hospital, and CT of the head was again reportedly normal. Blood levels of calcium, albumin, globulin, ammonia, thyrotropin, lactate, and troponin T were normal, as were the results of liver-function tests and urinalysis. Tests for Lyme disease antibodies, hepatitis B virus surface antigen, hepatitis C virus antibodies, rapid plasma reagin, antinuclear antibodies, rheumatoid factor, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) were negative, and levels of complement were normal. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. A lumbar puncture was performed; tests for antibodies to Borrelia burgdorferi and West Nile virus were negative, and a Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) test of the CSF was nonreactive (Table 2). The patient was transferred to this hospital for further evaluation. A review of systems provided by the patient’s family was notable for somnolence, fatigue, generalized weakness, unsteadiness, headaches, staring spells, floaters in the left eye, photophobia, sonophobia, mild neck stiffness, unintentional weight loss of 10 kg in the past 6 months, and nocturia. The patient reported no muscle or joint pain, rash, eye pain, diplopia, oral lesions, cough, dyspnea, nausea, or abdominal pain. His medical history was notable for hypertension, dyslipidemia, early-onset coronary artery disease for which he had received percutaneous coronary intervention in his 50s and for which he had undergone aortocoronary bypass grafting in his 60s, congenital color blindness, colonic polyps, and prostatic hypertrophy. Medications included cyclophosphamide, levetiracetam, aspirin, pravastatin, metoprolol, losartan, hydrochlorothiazide, trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole, omeprazole, calcium carbonate, cholecalciferol, ferrous sulfate, a multivitamin, and fluticasone. He had not taken other antibiotic agents or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs. The patient was a retired government employee and lived with his wife in northern New England. He had recently traveled to Florida and to rural Canada and had spent time hunting. He had smoked one pack of cigarettes per day for approximately 30 years but had quit 7 years before the current presentation. He drank two beers per week and did not use illicit substances. His family history included coronary artery disease in both parents and valvular disease in his mother, psoriatic arthritis in a sister, and sarcoidosis in several siblings; there was no history of renal or neurologic disease. The temperature was 37.2°C, the heart rate 73 beats per minute, the blood pressure 128/78 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 96% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 20.4. He appeared cachectic, with bitemporal wasting. He was somnolent and difficult to arouse with voice; he was oriented to self and intermittently to place, month, and year. His thoughts were perseverative. On mental-status examination, he was unable to name days of the week backward (he named a month and then named the days forward) and was unable to perform serial sevens calculations. Occasional word-finding difficulties were noted, although repetition, naming, and reading were generally intact. When asked to remember three words, he could recall only one word after 5 minutes. He reported that nine quarters equaled $4.25. His affect and speech were intact. The cranial-nerve examination revealed blurriness in the visual fields, “discomfort” with eye movements, and limited upward gaze. There was no weakness or pronator drift; a low-amplitude intention tremor was present in the left hand. The muscle tone was increased in both legs, with diffuse hyperreflexia, pectoralis reflexes, and seven beats of ankle clonus. The remainder of the examination was normal. Blood levels of calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, glycated hemoglobin, bilirubin, albumin, prealbumin, total protein, lactate dehydrogenase, high-density and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and thyrotropin were normal, as were the prothrombin time, partial-thromboplastin time, and results of liver-function tests; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. A comprehensive urine toxicology screen was negative, and a serum toxicology screen was negative for acetaminophen, salicylates, ethanol, and tricyclic antidepressants. Screening tests for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) types 1 and 2 and Treponema pallidum were negative. Cultures of the blood and urine were obtained. Dr. Pamela W. Schaefer: A chest radiograph was normal. CT of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed no hemorrhage, acute infarction, or mass lesion. Opacification of the right maxillary sinus was noted. MRI of the head (Figure 1) and magnetic resonance angiography of the head and neck revealed signal hyperintensity in the sulci on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images, with associated subtle enhancement on gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted images; additional subarachnoid and subdural foci characterized by restricted diffusion with no enhancement; nonspecific changes in the white matter; opacification of the right maxillary sinus; and no vascular abnormality. MRI of the spine revealed multilevel degenerative changes, without mass effect on the spinal cord, cord signal abnormality, or abnormal enhancement. Dr. Ard: Intravenous acyclovir, ceftriaxone, ampicillin, vancomycin, and thiamine were administered. On the second hospital day, the temperature was 37.6°C, and myoclonic jerks were noted; marked lethargy, photophobia, and nonsensical speech persisted. The patient was intermittently impulsive and uncooperative. The white-cell count was 17,960 per microliter (reference range, 4500 to 11,000), and the blood levels of vitamin B12, angiotensin-converting enzyme, complement, and haptoglobin and CD4+ T-cell subset counts were normal. ANCA, antinuclear antibodies, cryptococcal antigen, cytomegalovirus (CMV) DNA, Epstein–Barr virus DNA, galactomannan, and B. burgdorferi antibodies were not detected in the blood. A lumbar puncture was performed; the opening pressure was 10 cm of water, and the CSF was yellow and slightly turbid. Additional results of CSF analysis are shown in Table 2. CSF was obtained for culture, cytologic examination, and an autoimmune encephalopathy panel. An EEG showed intermittent periods of theta slowing in the bilateral posterior quadrants, with no epileptiform discharges. On examination by an ophthalmologist, bilateral visual acuity, visual fields, and intraocular pressure were normal, and there was no afferent pupillary defect. Slit-lamp examination of the eyes revealed bilateral posterior vitreal detachment but no cells in the anterior or posterior chambers. Dilated-eye examination revealed edema in both optic nerves, with tortuous vessels. There was no evidence of anterior uveitis, retinitis, or retinal necrosis. On the third hospital day, the temperature was 36.7°C, and the white-cell count was 8300 per microliter. The patient reported improved strength. Tests for bartonella antibodies and Tropheryma whipplei DNA were negative. Serum protein electrophoresis revealed a diffuse decrease in gamma globulin, with an IgG level of 378 mg per deciliter (reference range, 614 to 1295), an IgA level of 30 mg per deciliter (reference range, 69 to 309), and an IgM level of 7 mg per deciliter (reference range, 53 to 334); the serum free light chain levels and the results of immunoelectrophoresis were normal. A CSF VDRL test was nonreactive, and CSF testing was negative for cryptococcal antigen, eastern equine encephalitis antibodies, enterovirus RNA, West Nile virus RNA, herpes simplex virus (HSV) types 1 and 2 DNA, and varicella–zoster virus (VZV) DNA. On the fourth hospital day, the patient reported feeling better and having increased strength, which allowed him to walk. Blood tests for cryoglobulin, 1,3-β-d-glucan, and thyroid peroxidase antibodies were negative. On the fifth hospital day, the patient was calm and cooperative; oriented to person, place, and time; and able to follow complex commands. CSF tests for listeria antibodies, Epstein–Barr virus DNA, and human herpesvirus 6 DNA were negative, as were blood and urine tests for histoplasma antigens. A whole-body positron-emission tomographic (PET)–CT scan did not show fluorodeoxyglucose avidity. The results of a repeat lumbar puncture are shown in Table 2. A repeat ophthalmologic examination revealed the presence of vitreous cells, which were more numerous in the left eye than in the right eye; persistent edema in the left optic nerve; and an increase in the blind spot of the left eye on Humphrey visual-field testing. A fluorescein angiogram showed no evidence of ocular vasculitis.

Case Study 19
Title: A 53-Year-Old Woman with Headache and Gait Imbalance
Case Study:  Dr. Jacob M. Rosenberg: A 53-year-old woman was transferred to this hospital because of progressive headache, gait instability, and weight loss. Approximately 2 months before the patient’s evaluation at this hospital, vertigo developed and resolved spontaneously. One day before evaluation at this hospital, she sought care at another hospital for recurrent dizziness and difficulty walking. The temperature was 36.4°C, the pulse 86 beats per minute, the blood pressure 170/105 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 15 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while she was breathing ambient air. The patient was alert and oriented, with slow speech, bilateral end-point horizontal nystagmus, and mild dysmetria on the right side on finger–nose–finger testing. Strength and sensory function were normal. She had difficulty maintaining a stable stance; her gait was narrow-based and described as “slow and cautious.” The remainder of the examination was normal. Computed tomography (CT) of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, showed an area of ill-defined hypoattenuation that was consistent with vasogenic edema in the right cerebellar hemisphere, as well as regions of white-matter hypoattenuation in both cerebellar hemispheres. Aspirin and atorvastatin were administered. Dr. R. Gilberto Gonzalez: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head (Figure 1), performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed an enhancing intraaxial lesion, measuring 2.0 cm by 1.8 cm by 1.7 cm, in the right inferior cerebellar hemisphere. The lesion had internal signal hypointensity that was indicative of necrosis on T1-weighted imaging, as well as surrounding signal hyperintensity that was suggestive of vasogenic edema on T2-weighted imaging. There was local mass effect with effacement of the overlying cerebellar fissures and the fourth ventricle. There was also an enhancing leptomeningeal lesion, measuring 4 mm in diameter, along the left medial frontal lobe in the left superior frontal gyrus, with possible leptomeningeal extension. The lesion was characterized by internal and surrounding signal hyperintensity on T2-weighted imaging. Dr. Rosenberg: Intravenous dexamethasone, amlodipine, and labetalol were administered. The patient was transferred to this hospital for specialized neurosurgical consultation. On evaluation at this hospital, review of systems was notable for malaise and lethargy, as well as unintentional weight loss of 15 kg during the past year. The patient also reported an increase in urinary frequency without hematuria, dysuria, or flank pain. She had no fever, chills, sinus pain, dyspnea, cough, abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, or vomiting. She had a history of hypertension and hemorrhagic stroke, which had led to a craniotomy on the right side for evacuation of a “blood clot” 13 years before the current evaluation, with no reported neurologic deficits. The patient reported that, during the admission for craniotomy, she was told that she had human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and was treated with an unknown antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimen; she could not recall the medications included in the regimen. In addition, she reported that, several years later, further testing revealed that an error had been made and she did not have HIV infection. She reported that ART medications were discontinued at least 3 years before the current evaluation. The patient did not have a history of opportunistic infections or cancer. Three years earlier, a Mantoux tuberculin skin test had been negative. One week earlier, a mammogram had been normal. She had never undergone a colonoscopy or a Papanicolaou test. The patient was born in Ivory Coast, West Africa, and had been living in the United States for more than 20 years. She reported no recent travel. She lived with her children and did not smoke tobacco, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. She was divorced and not sexually active; in her lifetime, she had had one male sexual partner. Her ex-husband and one of her children reportedly had tested negative for HIV. Her father had had a myocardial infarction in his 60s; her mother and sisters were healthy. The patient had not been taking any medications at home before this illness and had no known allergies to medications. On physical examination, the temperature was 36.9°C, the blood pressure 165/99 mm Hg, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 22.5. The patient was comfortable, alert, and oriented. Her speech was clear, with intact naming and repetition. Her pupils were equal and reactive to light, extraocular movements were intact, and visual fields were full in response to confrontation. She had mild right esotropia and no nystagmus. Her face was symmetric, but there was mild deviation of the tongue to the left. Results of other cranial-nerve testing were normal. Finger–nose–finger testing revealed subtle dysmetria that was greater on the right side than on the left side; there was no dysdiadochokinesia or intention tremor. Her stance was approximately shoulder-width. Her balance was impaired, and her gait was unsteady and ataxic. Psychomotor slowing was present, and the Romberg sign was absent. An evaluation of power, bulk, tone, sensation, and deep-tendon reflexes was normal. She had alopecia and oral thrush. The remainder of the examination was normal. The patient was admitted to the hospital for further evaluation and treatment. Results of tests of renal, liver, and thyroid function were normal, as were blood levels of electrolytes, vitamin B12, and glycated hemoglobin. An HIV screening test for the detection of antibodies to HIV type 1 (HIV-1) and HIV type 2 (HIV-2) and HIV-1 p24 antigen was reactive. Plasma HIV-1 RNA was not detected. The CD4+ T-cell count was 39 per microliter (reference range, 348 to 1456). Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. A urine sample was obtained for culture. CT of the chest, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a mildly enlarged and multinodular left thyroid gland, as well as scattered pulmonary nodules measuring less than 4 mm in diameter. CT of the abdomen and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a hypoattenuating hepatic lesion measuring 1.1 cm in the greatest dimension that was consistent with hemangioma, as well as diffuse lytic osseous lesions in the thoracolumbar spine and pelvis.

Case Study 20
Title: A Woman with Recurrent Melanoma and Pulmonary Nodules
Case Study:  Dr. Justine V. Cohen: A 47-year-old woman with malignant melanoma was seen in the pulmonary clinic of this hospital because of new abnormal findings on chest imaging. The patient had observed routine quarterly surveillance imaging after resection of right axillary melanoma, radiation therapy, and initiation of pembrolizumab therapy 3 years earlier. The most recent imaging was performed 6 days before this evaluation. Dr. Jo-Anne O. Shepard: Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a patchy consolidation in the left upper lobe, bilateral hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy, and numerous bilateral scattered solid pulmonary nodules with associated ground-glass halos (Figure 1A through 1D). These findings were new relative to the most recent imaging performed 3 months earlier. Other pulmonary nodules, measuring 2 to 4 mm in greatest dimension, in the right upper lobe that had been noted on imaging studies obtained during the previous 3 years were stable. Changes in the right upper lobe that had resulted from radiation therapy were also stable relative to previous imaging studies. CT of the abdomen and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a hemangioma in the right hepatic lobe that measured 9 mm in greatest dimension and a cyst in the left hepatic lobe that measured 15 mm in diameter; both were unchanged from previous imaging studies. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, was normal. Dr. Cohen: The patient was referred by her oncologist for urgent evaluation in the pulmonary clinic of this hospital. On evaluation, the patient reported no symptoms, specifically no fever, weight loss, night sweats, fatigue, malaise, headache, chest pain, cough, hemoptysis, new or changed skin lesions (except a mild traumatic abrasion on the right arm), pruritus, or new masses. The patient’s medical history was notable for superficial spreading melanoma on the right upper back that had initially been diagnosed two decades before this evaluation and had been surgically excised, with clear pathological margins. Eleven years later, an in situ superficial spreading melanoma developed on the left upper back and was completely excised. Dr. Shepard: Three years before the current evaluation, locally advanced melanoma in the right axilla was diagnosed on the basis of a positron-emission tomographic and CT image that showed a 3.5-cm right axillary nodal conglomerate mass with multiple foci of intense 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake; no other sites of FDG avidity were seen (Figure 1E and 1F). Multiple pulmonary nodules, measuring 2 to 4 mm in greatest dimension, in the right lobe and hypodense hepatic lesions, measuring 9 mm in the right lobe and 10 mm in the left lobe, were noted. MRI of the abdomen suggested that the hepatic lesion in the right lobe corresponded to a hemangioma and the hepatic lesion in the left lobe a cyst. MRI of the head, performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, was normal. Dr. Cohen: At that time, dissection of the right axillary lymph nodes was performed, and examination of the specimens revealed metastatic melanoma in 25 of 39 lymph nodes, with a high degree of extracapsular extension. Molecular profiling identified the BRAF V600E mutation. The patient received radiation therapy to the right axilla and supraclavicular fossa (total dose of 4800 cGy over a period of 5 weeks), followed by pembrolizumab every 3 weeks for the next 12 months. During this course of treatment, lichenoid nodules developed on the fingers of both hands, tenosynovitis developed in the right ankle, and hypothyroidism was diagnosed, for which treatment with levothyroxine was initiated. These findings were attributed to adverse effects of the immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. The plan for surveillance imaging included CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, which was to be performed every 3 months, and MRI of the head, which was to be performed annually. The patient’s medical history also included bilateral ovarian cysts, osteopenia, and a melanocytoma of the left optic disc that had been stable for at least 13 years. A Papanicolaou smear and testing for high-risk human papillomavirus performed 3 years before this evaluation had been negative. Routine screening mammography performed 1 month before this evaluation had revealed dense breast tissue with bilateral calcifications that appeared to be benign; no suspicious lesions were noted. Medications included calcium carbonate, cholecalciferol, and levothyroxine. There were no known drug allergies. The patient was born on the northern coast of South America and had immigrated to the United States as a child. She lived in New England with her husband, two children, and two cats. She worked in the health care industry. She drank one or two glasses of wine per day and did not smoke tobacco or use illicit drugs. One month before this evaluation, she and her family had traveled to the northern coast of South America for 1 week. On the trip, the patient spent most her time outdoors, including taking trips to the jungle and swimming in fresh water, and ate local cuisine, such as water chestnuts. When she returned home with her family, her husband and one of her children had generalized myalgias and malaise that resolved spontaneously. The patient’s mother had breast cancer, melanoma, and basal-cell carcinoma; her father had prostate cancer; and her daughter had mixed connective-tissue disease. Her maternal grandfather had colon cancer, her paternal grandmother had breast cancer, and her maternal cousin had melanoma. On examination, the temperature was 37.0°C, the blood pressure 123/68 mm Hg, the pulse 56 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 20.8. She appeared well, and the lungs were clear on auscultation. Examination showed fair skin, multiple nevi without suspicious features, and healed scars at the sites of previous surgical procedures. There were lichenoid nodules on the fingers of both hands. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. The levels of electrolytes, glucose, and lactate dehydrogenase were normal, as were results of renal- and liver-function tests. The complete blood count and differential count were also normal. Blood samples were obtained for culture. An interferon-γ release assay for Mycobacterium tuberculosis was negative, and the level of 1,3-β-d-glucan was less than 31 pg per milliliter (reference value, <60).
