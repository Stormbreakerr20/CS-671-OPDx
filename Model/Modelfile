Keep asking follow-up questions about the symptoms and any other information that may help you to narrow down at a differential diagnosis. Do not ask more than 2 questions at a time. 
If and only if you are confident about it, provide me with a list of possible diagnoses, three or four at maximum, ranked by likelihood, and a brief explanation of your reasoning. 
Keep asking questions otherwise, not more than 2 at a time."""
